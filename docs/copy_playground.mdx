# Copy Playground

The **Copy Playground** is a simple template example suitable for testing
themes that you copy-paste from the **Themes Playground**. It is
intended to be used as a quick and simple app that you can use for
experimenting with themes you configured in the Themes Playground and want to
test on a device build.

The source code for this template is available in the example sub folder, in
folder [/example_copy_paste](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example_copy_paste).

You can of course test with a plain vanilla counter app too, or any
app where you want to try a theme. You may also find the **Copy Playground**
helpful since it includes presentation of all ColorScheme and Theme colors
and commonly used Flutter Material UI widgets. This makes it easy to see and
verify that the theme looks as intended with a large number of UI elements.

## Demonstration

The screen recording below demonstrates how to copy-paste a theme
from the Themes Playground and try in the Copy Playground.

At the start the **Copy Playground** app is set to use the default
Material 2 design guide theme created using `ThemeData.from` the
guide light and dark themes.

As we jump into the Themes Playground we start with the same scheme selected
in it just for illustration purposes.

We then turn ON FlexColorscheme and modify some settings, like border
radius on ElevatedButton and BottomSheet.
We add some surface blending and even use seed generated ColorScheme.
We have opted to keep the main color of the selected built-in scheme
**Pink Sakura** that we select as our scheme, in the generated `ColorScheme`.

When we are done configuring our scheme we **COPY** the generated setup
code, and **PASTE** it into the **Copy Playground** app into the
`MaterialApp` widget, making sure to comment or delete any
existing `theme` and `darkTheme` definitions.

If you are doing this in your own app you will need to first add
the `flex_color_scheme` package to your application and import it.
In the **Copy Playground** template this is already done.
Even the Google fonts package is imported, so we can easily also use the
same NotoSans font that the **Themes Playground** app uses.
This is done in this demo just to create and exact match of the result
on the mobile device.

When we hot-reload the **Copy Playground** app, we can see how it changes
to use the theme we just configured in the **Themes Playground**, it is
almost magical. In the Playground we use the Widget Showcase to compare
the colors and UI widget styles in the Themes Playground and in the
Copy Playground and verify that they are the same.
