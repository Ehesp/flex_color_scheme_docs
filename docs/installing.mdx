# Installing and Using

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your **Flutter** project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flex_color_scheme: ^5.0.0-dev.2
```

In your library file add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:flex_color_scheme/flex_color_scheme.dart';
```

You can now start using `FlexColorScheme` V5 based color schemes and theming
in your application. A quick way to do so is to try one of the **40** built-in
color schemes. The schemes have enums that you can use to refer to them with.

Please study the default example for a thorough guide on how to use almost
**all** properties in FlexColorScheme. To try it on your own from scratch,
create a default Flutter counter app. Add the FlexColorScheme import and modify
one line of code and add two lines as shown below.

Here we use the  **"Oh Mandy red"** color scheme that is represented by `enum`
value `FlexScheme.mandyRed`. We set the `MaterialApp.themeMode` to
`ThemeMode.system`, so that the device can control if the app uses its light
or dark theme mode, based on the device theme mode system setting. You can
toggle theme mode by changing theme mode on the device.

Assign `FlexThemeData.light` to the app's `theme`, which is the application's
light theme definition property, and `FlexThemeData.dark` to `darkTheme`.
For both `FlexThemeData` dark and light we set the `scheme` property to
`FlexScheme.mandyRed` to use the "Oh Mandy red" predefined `scheme` colors, and
get matching light and dark themes based on the scheme's color definitions.

The three line modified `MaterialApp` of the Flutter default counter app
becomes:

```dart
  class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      // The Mandy red, light theme.
      theme: FlexThemeData.light(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed),
      // The Mandy red, dark theme.
      darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed),
      // Use dark or light theme based on system setting.
      themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
```
The above additions to the Flutter default counter application, gives us the
following look on the familiar counter app:

_FlexColorScheme applied on the standard Flutter Counter Template_

Not as exciting as the theme image shown on the introduction page. That is because the basic
counter app uses very few features and widgets, therefore it cannot fully
demonstrate the results. This is why the included examples contain a lot of
demo UI code, that is not really relevant to using FlexColorScheme and is only
there to be able to properly demonstrate and show the results.
