# Installing and Using

The Flutter **FlexColorScheme** package is published on [**pub.dev**](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme).

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your **Flutter** project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flex_color_scheme: ^5.0.0-dev.2
```

In your library file add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:flex_color_scheme/flex_color_scheme.dart';
```

You can now start using `FlexColorScheme` based color schemes and theming
in your application. A quick way to do so is to try one of the **40** built-in
color schemes. The schemes have enum values that you can use to select
which one is used the theme.

The default example offers a heavily commented code guide on how to use almost
all properties in FlexColorScheme. The [examples](/examples) chapter shows you
how to try it, and all the [tutorial](/tutorial) examples.

## FlexColorScheme in Counter App

Let's setup FlexColorScheme in the default Flutter counter app.
First add the FlexColorScheme import, then modify one line of code, and add
two lines using these steps:

In this example we use the **Oh Mandy red** color scheme, it is
represented by `enum` value `FlexScheme.mandyRed`. We set
the `MaterialApp.themeMode` to `ThemeMode.system`, so that the device can
control if the app uses its light or dark theme mode, based on the device
theme mode system setting. You can toggle theme mode by changing theme mode
on the device.

Assign `FlexThemeData.light` to the app's `theme` property, which is the
application's light theme definition property, and `FlexThemeData.dark` to `darkTheme`.

For both `FlexThemeData` dark and light we set the `scheme` property to
`FlexScheme.mandyRed` to use the same **Oh Mandy red** predefined `scheme`
colors in both theme modes. We then get matching light and dark themes based on
the built-in scheme's color definitions.

The three line modified `MaterialApp` of the Flutter default counter app
becomes:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      // The Mandy red, light theme.
      theme: FlexThemeData.light(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed),
      // The Mandy red, dark theme.
      darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed),
      // Use dark or light theme based on system setting.
      themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
      home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}
```
The above additions to the Flutter default counter application, gives us the
following look on the familiar counter app:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>[<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-counter-01.png?raw=true" alt="Counter light" width="280"/>](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-counter-01.png?raw=true)</td>
    <td>[<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-counter-02.png?raw=true" alt="Counter dark" width="280"/>](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-counter-02.png?raw=true)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">_FlexColorScheme applied on the standard Flutter counter template_</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Maybe not as exciting as the images shown on the introduction page. That is because the basic
counter app uses very few features and widgets, therefore it cannot fully
demonstrate the results. This is why the included examples contain a lot of
demo UI code, that is not really relevant to using FlexColorScheme and is only
there to be able to properly demonstrate and show the results.
