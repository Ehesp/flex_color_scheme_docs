# Future Features

This chapter lists potential new features. They may be planned or even just idea phase future features. They are listed as polls in the repo [discussions](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/discussions). Feel free to add additional ideas and requests there, and to up or down vote existing ones. 

When features are being worked on you can find them as tasks in the repo [project](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/projects/1).

Adding new ideas as polls is a new practice that was started during 5.1.0 release. 

All internally recorded ideas have not yet been listed as polls in discussions, only a few so for to test the viability of this practice. This comment will be removed when currently elsewhere recorded ideas have been added to discussions as polls.

## Proposed Features

* [#66 Themes Playground, GUI for item size modifiers for BottomNavigationBar](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/discussions/66)

* [#67 Themes Playground, GUI for item size modifiers for NavigationBar](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/discussions/67)

* [#68 Themes Playground, GUI for item size modifiers for NavigationRail](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/discussions/68)

* [#69 Add CupertinoTheme support](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/discussions/69)


## Out of Scope

### Serialization of FlexColorScheme

Including built-in serialization of FlexColorScheme, and its key classes has been suggested. I consider `FlexColorScheme` to be functionally on a level similar to `ThemeData` and `ColorScheme`. Therefore, it should not cover serialization of itself. Serialization have to deal with a lot of potential failure points. We think it should not have to be a concern in this type of component. We are not planning to add it.

Our recommendation for saving the state of a `FlexColorScheme` is to include values for its settings that you use in your implementation in other models in your application, like an "AppSettings" model or similar.

You probably serialize and store such data already, perhaps with shared preferences, hive, get_storage or some other solution. Include the values you need for your `FlexColorScheme` implementation in your stored settings and then use those values to restore your `FlexColorScheme` configuration and theme. This way, your implementation also remain in control of what it needs to store and restore.

From version 4.0.0 a simple approach using the architecture introduced via the Flutter "skeleton" template in Flutter version 2.5 was used together with Shared Preferences and Hive to persist and load FlexColorScheme on start. This is just one example, other implementations together with Riverpod, Provider, Flutter Bloc, GetX etc., and completely different local persistence packages work well too.
