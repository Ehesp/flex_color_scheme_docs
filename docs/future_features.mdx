# Future Features

This chapter lists potential new features. They may be planned or even just idea phase new future features. They are listed as polls in the repo [discussions](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/discussions). Feel free to add additional ideas and requests there. 

When features are being worked on you can find them as tasks in the repo [project](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/projects/1).

Adding new ideas as polls is a new practice that was started during 5.1.0 release. New features and todos before version 5.0.0 can be found at the end of the repo changelog. Those features have all been implemented. This practice allows for easy voting on the features as well as deeper discussions.

All internally recorded ideas have not yet been listed as polls in discussions, only a few so for to test the viability of this practice. This comment will be removed when currently elsewhere recorded ideas have been added to discussions as polls.
