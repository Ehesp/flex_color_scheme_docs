# All Color Schemes

Color schemes are not fun without some built-in schemes ready to try and use.
**FlexColorScheme** comes bundled with **36** ready to go matching light
and dark color schemes. You you can use them in your applications if you like.

In the [**scheme reference**](#scheme-reference) you can find a table listing
all the built-in color schemes with their `FlexScheme` enum value, name and
description.

Another convenient and recommended way to see and try all the predefined color
schemes is by using the Web versions of the package
[example 4 "All Themes"](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut4) and of course
[example 5 "Themes Playground"](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut5) is
the ultimate showcase of all the built-in color schemes.
Using it you can try all the built-in color schemes with theming options,
and see the impact they have on often used Flutter UI widgets.

## Built-in Color Scheme Designs

The built-in color schemes are all tuned matching light and dark scheme pairs.
Most of them are pretty conservative, but some are intentionally a bit more
playful and bold. The first two color schemes are actually the Flutter and
Material 2 Design Guide examples of light and dark color schemes, and the Flutter
high contrast light and dark color versions as well. So OK, there are actually
"only" 34 new and different from standard Flutter ready-made light and dark
color scheme pairs. The color scheme "Amber blue" is also a high-contrast theme.
An alternative to the built-in Material high contrast theme.

The built-in schemes do not claim to be a "this selection" fits all needs
collection. Nor do they claim to be more correct than any other color scheme.
What fits your needs and looks good to you, is the right choice for your
application and use case.

You can make your own custom scheme totally from scratch, or use the built-in
ones as a starting point and inspiration. You can re-use colors from existing
schemes, via their const `FlexColor` name. All the color values in the color
schemes are available as const values, so you can easily make new custom
combinations using existing color schemes and add a few custom ones to the mix.

## Use Your Own Color Schemes with FlexColorScheme

The package examples show how you can easily make and use your own custom
color schemes with FlexColorScheme. Maybe the built-in examples will inspire
your creative side to define your own schemes. The tutorial walks you through
how to define your own color schemes and make themes based on them.

You can create your own custom list of schemes, then use this list with
only your own custom color schemes selection. You may also append some, or
even all the built-in schemes after your custom schemes, and give your
users a lot of theme options. How to do this is demonstrated in the tutorial
in examples 4 and 5.

Where did the built-in color schemes come from? While building, testing and
using this package over a long period of time, a number
of color schemes were born as a side product. I decided to include them in
FlexColorscheme and offer them for re-use and inspiration as they are. It is
however not necessary to use them to reap the benefits of FlexColorScheme.

The color and scheme definitions for the built-in color schemes are in their
own class. They will not be included in the release compiled version of your
application if you do not use (reference) them in your application, and instead
only use your own custom color schemes for the themes.
