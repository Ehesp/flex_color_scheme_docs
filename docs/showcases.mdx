### [Flexfold Demo](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold)

An already classic example of **FlexColorScheme** usage can be seen in the Flutter web [**Flexfold demo app**](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold).

The live version of the Flexfold demo is still using FlexColorScheme version 3. As can be seen, it was very capable already back then. Example 5, the **Themes Playground** app now has many more options and offers considerably more advanced theming features than the Flexfold demo ever did.
