# Showcases

Here we feature and showcase some applications that use FlexColorScheme.

We would love to show and feature more applications using FlexColorScheme. If you have an application that uses FlexColorScheme and would like a mention and to be featured here, then please drop some screenshots in the FlexColorScheme GitHub discussions [show and tell](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) section, and we can take it from there.

### [Flexfold Demo](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold)

An already classic example of **FlexColorScheme** usage can be seen in the Flutter web [**Flexfold demo app**](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold). You can read more about the Flexfold demo app [here](https://rydmike.com/flexfold).

The live version of the Flexfold demo is still using FlexColorScheme version 3. As can be seen, it was very capable already back then. Example 5, the **Themes Playground** app now has many more options and offers considerably more advanced theming features than the Flexfold demo ever did.
