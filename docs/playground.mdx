# Using Themes Playground

**TODO: Add guide on how to use Themes Playground V5**

The side menu in the default example is actually made for and used
in the last example in the tutorial. The final example
doubles as an interactive **Themes Playground** application.

The **Themes Playground** is useful as a tool to find themes and settings you
prefer, or just use it to figure out what you can do with
FlexColorScheme. The playground persists all its settings, and you can
reset them back to their default values. It can even generate the Flutter
FlxColorScheme setup code needed to produce the shown active theme.

The **Themes Playground** can be used as a [web app
here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut5). Its source code
is also available in the example sub folder in folder
[/example5](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example5).

It is recommended to go through the tutorial further below to get introduced to
all features step by step. However, feel free to go straight for example 5 if
your really like to dive into the deep end. It is a bit more advanced example
than those generally bundled with packages, but not that complicated.

The **Themes Playground** web app is best experienced at as high resolution as
possible, preferably even 4k. It is responsive and works splendidly down to
phone sizes too. It is however easier to see and experience what each
configuration option in FlexColorScheme does, when you use a large screen
with high resolution, because then you can see the result of all settings at
one glance.

With the Themes Playground you can also copy any built-in color scheme to a
customizable color scheme, that you can modify by clicking
on the four main scheme colors in the custom scheme. The Themes Playground
can also generate FlexColorScheme setup code that will create the same
color scheme and theme that you are looking. All you have to do is copy the
code and paste it into your app. You can find an example in this
