# Themes Playground

This chapter goes through the basics of how to use the Themes Playground. Generally
it is simple and you probably don't need a guide, but if you get stuck on some
finer points, you might find answers here.

The [**Themes Playground**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5)
is a useful tool to find **FlexColorScheme** themes and settings you
like. You can also use it to learn what you can do with FlexColorScheme.
The playground persists all its settings, and you can reset them back to their
default values, so don't be afraid to experiment.

The most useful feature of the **Themes Playground** is that it can
generate the Dart and Flutter FlexColorScheme setup code needed to
produce the shown active theme configuration. It even shows and modifies the
setup code as you change settings, and you can see the code side-by-side as
you change settings. This is a fun way to get familiar with the API.
Beware, fiddling with all the different themes and settings can be quite
addictive! ðŸ’™

The **Themes Playground** can be used as a
[web app here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5).

## Open Source

The **Themes Playground** application is open source and is bundled with
the `FlexColorScheme` package in the example sub-folder. In its GitHub repository
you can find it here
[/example/lib/example5](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example5).

The playground is also the last step in the package tutorial series. The tutorial goes
through its main used features that are relevant to using `FlexColorScheme`,
and features that differ from the previous examples. It does not go through all
the details of the application. You are welcome to study its source code for
more insights if it is of interest. It is on purposes a bit excessively
commented. The tutorial also briefly talks about it's background, design choices
and limitations.

All the example apps are built from the example folder source code
included with the package. The web builds and deployments are automated using
GitHub actions, that are included in the GitHub repository as well.

## Two Layouts

The Themes Playground application offers two view modes.

1. Topic based page views.
2. Topic based collapsible panels, in a large masonry style grid view.

Both views have their pros and cons. On smaller screens and phone
devices, the topic based page view is more practical to use.

The masonry based grid view is best experienced at as high resolution as
possible, preferably even 4k.

Both views are very responsive and work very well down to small phone media
sizes, even in landscape mode. Still they both benefit a lot from larger
media sizes. Mostly because when you use a larger screen with high resolution,
you can see the result of more settings at one glance.

The page view becomes more useful at typical landscape tablet sizes or larger.
At those sizes you can see the generated setup code in a side-by-side view
with each page's configuration topic.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="page"
  values={[
    {label: 'Page View', value: 'page'},
    {label: 'Masonry Grid View', value: 'masonry'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="page">

    caption="Themes Playground - Masonry grid view with collapsible topic panels, responsiveness demo."
    alt="masonry view demo" zoom />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

With the masonry grid, you can open and close multiple panels, including the
code view, and change settings across multiple panels and see the impact on
all of them. Sometimes having the right combination of panels with different
topics open at the same time, is useful in order to see and understand the
impact of different theme settings. While some settings are by their nature
limited to only affecting the components shown on the same topic page. We will
explore some examples of both cases.

## Interactive Theme

When you change settings in this application, be it colors, border radius and
other styles, it is important to recognize that there is **no** code
in this application, or the other examples, that sets color and style on any of
the displayed components being modified.

What is happening is that you are manipulating the global theme
for the application, and the application is being rebuilt with a new theme
interactively and in real time. Every time you modify settings, it creates a
a new `ThemeData` object that the application uses. This is probably not
something you would do in a typical application, not to the extent this
application does it anyway. Still as demonstrated in this application, you
clearly can.

Some of the theme changes can be a bit taxing calculation wise.
Some changes that appear to be lagging behind, are so due to the theme
change animation. The `MaterialApp` always lerp animates a theme change from
previous `ThemeData` value, to the new `ThemeData`. So when you drag sliders
to change border radius, this triggers an animation from a complete
`ThemeData` based on the previous slider value to the next one, based on the new
slider value, for every rapid slider value change. This can be seen as a slight
delay in the manifestation of the latest values, as the theme is animating to the
last slider value. This can certainly be avoided by not triggering a theme change
until the slider change is complete, but in this case we preferred to see the
change as the slider is being adjusted.

<Image src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-pg-03-radius-change-1.gif?raw=true"
caption="ThemeData animated change continues a bit after slider change stops, plus realtime code update."
alt="border change radius demo" zoom />

In the above recording you can see how the application's look, and all
widgets in it, change as we switch FlexColorScheme theming from being
completely OFF to ON, and then turn on using component sub-themes, and lastly as
we manipulate the `defaultBorder` radius for all widgets. Observe that it also
changes all buttons, cards and other elements used by the application itself.

## Code Generation

When you open the page view on a large enough screen you will see the generated
setup code, side-by-side with the settings you are changing. Not only is the
entire theme of the application changing as you modify settings interactively,
the code generated that you need to setup the same theme, is changing as you
change settings too.

In the above screen recoding you can see this. Pay for example attention
to the `defaultRadius` value above as the slider is dragged around.

The generated code aims to exclude code when API default values can be used, and
to also exclude settings that become redundant if covered by some other value.

## Copy Setup Code

Whenever you want the code, you can copy it to the clipboard with the copy
button and paste it into your project to use it.

You can also at any time, in any view, use the drawer, side rail or side menu
action item "Copy theme code". This will open a dialog that shows the current
theme setup code with a copy icon as well. This action button and dialog
view can be practical on smaller sized media where you cannot see the code
side-by-side with the configuration controls.

[<Image src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-pg-04-copy-code.png?raw=true"
caption="Copy theme setup code, via side action or COPY button in code view."
alt="Copy code" zoom />](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-pg-04-copy-code.png?raw=true)

Once you have copied the code for the setup you configured, you can paste it,
and use it as-is in your application, or use it as base for further
modifications. You can also paint and select only parts of the code, and
copy just a few lines, which might be useful if you only modified a
few settings from previous configuration.

If you want to quickly test out themes on a pre-made template app, you
can use the [Copy Playground Theme](/copy_playground), it is useful since it
includes presentation of all colors and common Flutter Material UI widgets.
You can use them to verify that the theme looks as intended.

## Smart Controls

The user interface disables controls and settings that are not available
in a given configuration. For example, when you turn OFF FlexColorScheme, there
are not many controls that can be operated, with opinionated component sub-themes
OFF, most controls are still disabled.

When you enable component sub-themes, most controls are available. However, there
are a few that are disabled in certain combination, or only appear under some given
conditions. Like using computed dark theme, or which color input to use on custom
dark theme as keep color for the seeded ColorSchemes, to mention a few.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="disabled"
  values={[
    {label: 'None relevant disabled', value: 'disabled'},
    {label: 'Enabled when available', value: 'enabled'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="disabled">
    [<Image src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-pg-05-unavailable-controls.png?raw=true"
    caption="Controls that have no function in a given configuration are disabled."
    alt="Unavailable controls" zoom />](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-pg-05-unavailable-controls.png?raw=true)

    caption="Most controls are available when component themes are enabled."
    alt="Available controls" zoom />](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-pg-06-available-controls.png?raw=true)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Controls also know and show different default values depending on your settings.
If you turn OFF using FlexColorScheme, toggle using component sub-themes, and
even change using the default radius to a fixed value. Widgets know and tell you
what their default value is in each situation.

The default value in each situation, means the default style and behavior a
component will use, when a given property value is undefined.
When you turn OFF using component themes, or FlexColorscheme entirely, it shows
the default for that mode. In the above example the radius widget also becomes
disabled.

This undefined defaults are different if FlexColorScheme is not used at all,
then you are looking at Flutter SDK default behavior for the widget. If you
turn ON FlexColorScheme, but keep component sub-themes OFF, then you are
looking at the FlexColorScheme [core defaults](/core_defaults). Mostly they are
the same as when not using FlexColorScheme at all, but for certain colors and
elevations they too differ. The FlexColorScheme [core defaults](/core_defaults)
explains, how, when and why FlexColorScheme core without component themes
enabled differs from Flutter SDK.

With component sub-themes on, you again get different defaults, especially for
border radius that default to Material 3 specifications where border radius
varies a lot per component type.

If you when using component sub-themes, keep `defaultRadius` undefined,
then each component widget will use its Material 3 default border radius value
and show that value when an individual widget border radius has not
been specified with its slider.

</Tabs>

When you set a global default radius, component themes will show and use that
values as their default border radius when not defined, and also state that
it comes from the global border radius default. If a component widget has
specified its own border radius it shows that value. If you then turn OFF
component sub-themes, it will get disabled and show Flutter SDK Material 2
default border radius (4 dp) again.

This type of logic applies so far to border radius, various differences in
default colors and elevations, when FlexColorScheme is not used at all, is used,
but component themes are not enabled, and when they are enabled.

Small details like this, helps you keep on top of what default values are used
when. Controls that are only available when they actually have an impact on
the resulting theme, means they can only be operated when they can impact
the resulting theme.

## Input Colors

The input colors is your view into your scheme's raw input colors. There are
settings you can use to manipulate the input colors with before they are
used to create the effective `ColorScheme` for the theme.

You can swap primary and secondary colors, including their container colors.
Reduce the amount of used colors,
and in dark mode use computed dark theme. Computed dark theme is useful if
you have only defined colors for your light theme, when making custom themes.

</Tabs>

In the above case, using the masonry grid view on a large screen is helpful, since
we can open and close panels to configure the view like above, and then see the
input colors and the detailed full effective `ColorScheme` at the same time.

## Seeded ColorScheme

Using seeded ColorScheme is a way to use the Material 3 color scheme generation
algorithms, that generates complete and well balanced `ColorScheme`s for both
light and dark theme mode, from only one or a few input key color values.

Flutter only directly offers using a single color, a main or primary color, as
seed color for the generated ColorScheme. With FlexColorScheme, you can use
the same setup, but you can go further and also use secondary and tertiary input
colors as keys to generate the ColorScheme.

The input key colors could also be extracted and sourced from images, like e.g.
the device wall-paper, or even from image used in an app or seen in a flow
of images, and then used in FlexColorScheme to generate the `ColorScheme` from
them.

Using a Seeded ColorScheme is also a form of input color modifier, since it takes
the color values defined for the light theme's primary, secondary and tertiary
colors, and computes an entirely new derived `ColorScheme` from them.

Below we can see the **Flutter Dash** theme:

1. As defined by built-in colors, with no seeded `ColorScheme`.

2. With a single color, the built-in light theme mode primary color from
   the **Flutter Dash** theme, used as key color to seed the generated
   `ColorScheme` used to make the theme. This is the same result we get if
   if we use Flutter SDK `ColorScheme.fromSeed` with its primary
   light theme mode color.

3. Using three key colors, from the built-in light theme mode **Flutter Dash**
   theme. Its primary, secondary and tertiary colors are used for each
   main generated Tonal Palette. This type of seed generated `ColorScheme` is
   not directly available in the Flutter SDK.

4. In the last version we lock the main colors, primary, secondary and tertiary,
   to keep using their defined Flutter Dash "brand" colors, but let all the other
   colors for the ColorScheme be computed. Generally they look very balanced
   and nice and will typically make an app using Material 3 color system
   look great, but as mentioned often you may want to use main colors as
   required by the brand or customer requirements.

## Tonal Palettes

What are the Tonal Palettes? They are described in detail in the Material 3
guide's new color system [here](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/the-color-system/key-colors-tones).
The short version, a Material 3 ColorScheme uses six different Tonal Palettes,
with 13 colors tones (shades) each:

- Primary palette
- Secondary palette
- Tertiary palette
- Error palette
- Neutral palette
- Neutral variant palette

The ColorScheme uses colors from these palettes for its colors, by using a
predefined tone for each color from given palettes. The light and matching
dark mode ColorScheme use the same tonal palettes, they just use different
tones from the same palette for corresponding colors.

The Material 3 color system calculation algorithm produces the above tonal
palettes based on given input color and then colors from the palettes
are assigned to the resulting ColorScheme.

When you use seed generated ColorSchemes in the Themes Playground, you can
see all the generated Tonal Palettes, they are shown in the above order.

Below we can see the Tonal Palettes when using the Flutter SDK default Material
3 based ColorScheme tonal palette generation algorithm, using a single input
key color. It is shown in both light and dark theme. We can see that the
Tonal Palettes for both light and dark theme modes are identical, what varies is
which tones are used for each color by the light and dark theme mode `ColorScheme`.

For example, tone 40 is used from primary Tonal Palette for the
`ColorScheme.primary` color in light theme mode, while tone 80 is
used in dark theme mode. On the web and a desktop build of the app, if you
hover with the mouse over a seeded `ColorScheme` color, its source color will
be highlighted in the computed Tonal Palette.

For comparison, we above also see the same Flutter Dash theme based Tonal Palette
generation when using primary, secondary and tertiary colors as seed key input
colors, instead of only primary color. This time as an example showing the
tone mapping of the tertiary container color in light and dark theme mode.

## Flex Tones

Above we saw that even when we used three input color as keys, we did not get so much
of the chroma in the used input color in the resulting Tonal Palettes for the
secondary and tertiary colors. This is because the default Material 3 tonal palette
calculation algorithm locks chroma for secondary tonal palette generation to 16,
and it is using the hue from the used key color.

The primary tonal palette uses the chroma and hue from the key color, but chroma
is only used if it is higher than 48, if it is lower, 48 is used. This keeps
ensures that is always of minimum and suitable color saturation.

For the tertiary tonal palette, chroma is locked to 24, so a bit more colorful
than secondary, which can also be seen in the produced palettes. Additionally
hue is rotated +60 from the input key color hue, effectively generating a new
hue based on the single input key color.

The neutral palettes are also using the same key color as input, but with
very low chroma, 4 for the neutral palette and 8 for the neutral variant palette.
This will create neutral surface colors that contain a hint of the key (primary) color
in the surfaces as well. This is similar in concept to the primary color surface
blends that FlexColorScheme has used since version 1.0. In the [Surface Blends](/playground#surface-blends)
chapter below, we will se that surface blends can optionally also be used when
using seed generated ColorSchemes. Many of the example screen shots
above already did so.

Lastly the error tonal palette is simply made from a fixed color value,
having hue 25 and chroma 84.

When we used key colors also for the secondary and tertiary tonal palette
generation, it above meant we substituted the hue for secondary and tertiary
tonal palettes to use the hue in their own input key colors to generate palettes,
and no longer rely on the values derived from the single input primary color.

We did however not do anything to the chroma limits used by the default Material 3
design based Tonal Palette color generation algorithm parameters.

FlexColorScheme, would not be "flex" if it would not let us modify this too.
We can set custom parameters for the keys, that define the chroma limits we will
use as limits for the input colors when we generate their tonal palettes. We
can lock it to a given value, or we can let it use whatever chroma it has, or
we can say it can use whatever chroma it has, as long as it is over a
certain limit. This is useful because if the chroma is very low in the input color,
we basically get an almost greyscale tonal palette, like the neutral tonal palette
colors. With the `FlexTones` API you can define these limits as desired for the
tonal palette generation.

We can do even more than this, we can also modify the mapping of which
tone is used for what color in the `ColorScheme` from the generated Tonal
Palettes, as long as it is from the source palette intended for
color in the `ColorScheme`. Not all tones are useful, but for some cases you
can very well go up or down a tone for a given color in the ColorScheme mapping,
for a stronger more contrasty look or an even more muted one.

Current version of Themes Playground only lets you change `FlexTone` settings between
five pre-made configurations. It is however very simple to make custom configurations
with the API. The pre-made ones are mainly intended as examples. You can read more about
`FlexTones` and its usage in the package API reference
[here](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexTones-class.html).

Maybe in some future version of the Theme Playground custom interactive configuration
of `FlexTones` will be added. For now let us compare the built-in ones we can swap
between in the current version. When you select a pre-made `FlexTones` configuration,
the Theme Playground app shows a brief summary of its configuration.

The "Vivid" colors may actually not always be more "vivid" than the Material 3
FlexTones configuration. What they actually are, is closer in color intent to
the used input key color, for each generated main tonal palette, than what
the default Material 3 configuration is. This means you will get a generated
`ColorScheme` that looks a bit more like the input colors you used.

## Surface Blends

With surface blends FlexColorScheme refers to using alpha blends to mix in a hint
of a color, at the moment only primary color, into different Material
surface colors.

The Material 2 guide also talks about using alpha blends to create branded surface
colors, especially in dark mode. In this
[tweet from 2020](https://twitter.com/RydMike/status/1281293363233390599) I
show an example of how to create such color tinted background and surface
colors, using the `Color.alphaBlend` function.

[<Image src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-pg-27-blends-tweet.png?raw=true"
caption="Creating branded surfaces - tweet anno 20202, but still valid."
alt="Tweet surface blends 2020"/>](https://twitter.com/RydMike/status/1281293363233390599)

The above is exactly what FlexColorScheme does when you configure it to
use surface blends.
It also adds different blend modes and variable alpha blend levels,
basically just the percentage above that is then varied per surface type.
Or with a bit more detail, the different surface blend modes varies the
defined alpha blend level value using different fractional factors for
different Flutter surface types.

Originally there were only two main surface colors in the `ColorScheme`, those
were `surface` and `background`. However, FlexColorScheme also treats the
Scaffold background and in some modes, even dialog backgrounds as
their own themed surface colors.

In addition to being able to blend in primary color in surfaces, starting in
version 5, the "color" of a container, can be blended into its own onColor,
to give the onColor a tint of the color itself. This blending is done more
subtly than the surface colors. For onPrimary, onSecondary, onTertiary
and onError it can be even turned OFF completely, while still being used on
the other onColors.

This feature was added because Material 3 design keeps the onColors for
the main colors white in light theme mode, however in dark theme mode that is
not the case. With the available settings you can decide if you follow this
principle or not when not using Material 3 seed generate ColorSchemes.

When using the seed generated ColorScheme, this depends on the tone mapping
in used FlexTones.

Seed generated ColorSchemes can also used surface blends, since Material 3 style
generated `ColorScheme`s already includes a hint of primary color in all neutral
tones, it means that they start with some primary color baked in. When you
add surface blends to them, you can further strength the effect. Since they
don't start at white and and almost black, like pure Material 2 surfaces, it
means the get much stronger primary color blends at same blend levels compared
to when generated `ColorsScheme` is not being used. For a pure Material 3 guide
design intent, keep blend level at zero.

Generated `ColorScheme`s can not use onColor blending. This is because such
themes already covers this design aspect by using tones from the Tonal Palettes
the effectively accomplishes the same thing and often with a better, or let's
call it a more balanced looking result.

However, when you "keep" e.g. primary color in a seed generated ColorSchemes,
its onPrimary color can then use onColor blending.
Therefore this setting is not disabled when using Seeded ColorScheme, but it
will only impact onColors belonging to main or container colors being kept at
their original input color.

The above may sound complicated, but using it is not, you can just fiddle with
settings until you find something you like. The screen recording below
show the surface blend modes at same mid level, and then one of the surface
modes from no blend level to maximum blend level.

The other screen recording shows the onColor blending options and levels.
The onColor impacts the color you should use for text on container surfaces
when you use and place them on its none "on" color container. The impact of
this not so visible above. Generally in the application, they still create a
remarkable subtle toned difference. Most notice it, but might not be able to
immediately explain what the causes the difference.

This is especially true for the Material 3 generated ColorSchemes, that use
the matching lighter/darker tones for their onColors, which are often brighter
and more impactful than the simpler alpha blended version.

In both cases above, pay attention to effective surface, container colors and
their onColors, and how they change. Also look at the app to see how it
visually changes as blends are varied.


## Custom Colors

Pretty much any color in a box and color code you see in the Themes
Playground can be tapped and its color value is then copied to the
Clipboard in Dart format. This is handy if you want to snipe any cool color
you see. This works from the individual generated Tonal Palette colors too.

You can copy any pre-made color scheme to the last scheme in the
Themes Playground app, and use its colors as a base for a completely custom
colored. You can select and edit colors with the
[FlexColorPicker](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_picker). The color picker
also allows you to enter or paste in color values to it to define the custom
colors for each color in the custom input colors.

## Copy ColorScheme

Only want the complete `ColorScheme` of the color scheme for the theme mode
you are looking at? No problem, you can copy it too and get a ready
made standard Flutter `ColorScheme` class for it.

You can use this feature if you prefer to not use any of FlexColorScheme's
theming features. Maybe you prefer to build your custom theme from scratch, but
still find creating `ColorScheme` objects with the Themes Playground helpful.
