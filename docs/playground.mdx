# Using Themes Playground

**TODO: Add NEW guide on how to use Themes Playground V5**

This chapter goes through basics of how to use the Themes Playground. Generally
it is simple enough and you probably not need a guide, but if you get stuck on some
finer point, you might find answers here.

The [**Themes Playground**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5)
is a useful tool to find **FlexColorScheme** themes and settings you
like. You can also use it to see what you can do with FlexColorScheme.
The playground persists all its settings, and you can reset them back to their
default values so don't be afraid to experiment.

The most important feature of the **Themes Playground**
is that it can generate the Flutter FlexColorScheme setup code needed to
produce the shown active theme configuration. It even shows and modifies the
setup code, as you modify settings, and you can see it side-by-side with your
settings. This is a fun way to get familiar with the API too.

The **Themes Playground** can be used as a
[web app here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5).

## OpenSource

The **Themes Playground** application is open source and it is available and bundled
in the `FlexColorScheme` package example sub-folder in
[/example/lib/example5](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example5).

The playground is actually the last step in the tutorial series. The tutorial goes
through its main used features, that are relevant to using `FlexColorScheme`
and that differ from the other examples. It does not go through all the details
of the application. You are welcome to study its source code for more details,
it is on purposes a bit excessively commented. The tutorial also talks about
it's background, design choices and limitations.

All the example live web apps are built from the example folder source code
included with the package. The web builds and deployments are automated using
GitHub actions, included in the GitHub repository as well.

## Two Layouts

The Themes Playground application offers two view modes.

1. Topic based page view.
2. Topic based panels in a large masonry style grid view.

Both views have their pros and cons. On smaller screens and phone
devices the topic based page view is more practical to use.

The masonry grid view is best experienced at as high resolution as
possible, preferably even 4k.

Both views are very responsive and work very well down to small phone media
sizes, also in their landscape mode. Still they both benefit a lot from larger
media sizes. Mostly because when you use a large screen with high resolution,
then you can see the result of all settings at one glance.

The page view becomes more useful at typical landscape tablet sizes, since
at that size you can see the generated setup code in a side by side view, on each
configuration topic screen.

With the masonry grid, you can open and close multiple panels, including the
code view, and change settings across multiple panels and see the impact on
all of them.


With the Themes Playground you can also copy any built-in color scheme to a
customizable color scheme, that you can modify by clicking
on the four main scheme colors in the custom scheme. The Themes Playground
can also generate FlexColorScheme setup code that will create the same
color scheme and theme that you are looking. All you have to do is copy the
code and paste it into your app. You can find an example in this
