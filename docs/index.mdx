# FlexColorScheme Welcome

Use **FlexColorScheme** to make beautiful color scheme based Flutter themes,
with optional primary color surface blends. The themes are based on the same
concept as Flutter's ColorScheme based themes, but with many
additional features.

When you color theme a Flutter application, all built in
widgets use the colors of the `ColorScheme` in your theme. At least in theory,
and it is almost so if you defined your Flutter ThemeData by using the
`ThemeData.from` factory, but even it misses a few details.
**FlexColorScheme** goes the extra mile to ensure that all Flutter SDK widgets gets
themed completely by its built-in color schemes, or custom colors you provide.

You can also opt in on using pre-made opinionated widget sub-themes.
By opting in, you can for example adjust the border radius on all widgets
with a single property to set the same themed border radius on all of them with
one property. Current Flutter SDK widgets are based on the Material 2 guide
and use 4 dp corner radius as default on most corners.

When you opt in on using the sub themes, the border radius on widgets default
to the new rounded corners as specified by the
[Material 3 guide](https://m3.material.io/), where the
rounding varies by widget type. You can stick with this, or set global
radius to a value you prefer. You can also easily set the themed border
radius per widget and override the shared radius value in just a few cases. Use
simple property values per widget, no need for verbose custom sub theme
Shape definitions.
