## Release Notice V5.0.0-dev.2

**The documentation in this site has not yet been updated to version 5**

**Version 5 docs are still a work in progress**

FlexColorScheme [Version 5](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/5.0.0-dev.2)
is a big refactor from version 4, with deprecation of previous `variant` based color names in
favor of `container` ones that were added to updated Material 3 based `ColorScheme` in Flutter 2.10.0.

The same additions and changes are now also introduced in FlexColorScheme. Despite being a very big release,
with many new features, actual breaking changes are very few and mostly concerns in version 4 already
deprecated members and of course requiring minimum Flutter 2.10.0 to work.

Version 5 has many new advanced coloring features and fully supports Material 3 based color schemes,
including more powerful seed generated color schemes than what is available in Flutter SDK directly.

Version 5 also comes with many more convenient component sub-theming options compared to previous
versions.

The companion app, the [**Themes Playground**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5)
has been completely revised and has two view modes, the previous large masonry grid, but also a
convenient topic based page view. In the new version you can also see the generated theme setup
code as you change your theming settings. The app is still open source, more will be written
about it in the docs and may an article as well later.

This is a **minor breaking** release, with many major new Material 3 ColorScheme features.
See [change log](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/5.0.0-dev.2/changelog) for detailed change information.
Generated [API docs](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/5.0.0-dev.2/flex_color_scheme/flex_color_scheme-library.html)
are available and up to date with version 5.
The samples have also been updated, the live web builds of them are available here:
* [Basic Theme](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/basictheme-v5)
* [Custom Theme](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/customtheme-v5)

* [All Themes](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/allthemes-v5)
* [Themes Playground](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5)
  The new version 5 of the **Themes Playground** demonstrates all the new features,
  including using Material 3 key color based seeded ColorSchemes.
* The default example **Hot Reload Playground** has also been updated.
  Its comments contain a lot of verbose documentation that can guide with getting started too.
* The sample with the **Copy Playground Theme** template, that can be used to test themes
  using copy-pasted theme setup code from the Themes Playground, is also up-to-date.

## Introduction

**TODO: Review and update Introduction chapter to version 5 - New image**

Use **FlexColorScheme** to make beautiful color scheme based Flutter themes,
with optional primary color surface blends or use key color seeded schemes.
The themes are based on the same concept as Flutter's ColorScheme based themes,
but with many additional features.

_FlexColorScheme theme examples (click image to open hires version)_

When you color theme a Flutter application, all built in
widgets use the colors of the `ColorScheme` in your theme. At least in theory,
and it is almost so if you defined your Flutter ThemeData by using the
`ThemeData.from` factory, but even it still misses a few details.
**FlexColorScheme** ensured that all Flutter SDK widgets gets
themed completely by its built-in color schemes, or custom colors you provide,
it also applies all the `ColorScheme` based colors to all direct color
properties in `ThemeData`, as long as they still exist, making sure the colors
in `ThemeData` match your `ColorScheme`.

You can also opt-in on using opinionated component sub-themes.
By opting in, you can for example adjust the border radius on all UI widgets
with a single property to set the same themed border radius on all of them with
one property. Current Flutter SDK widgets are based on the Material 2 guide
and use 4 dp corner radius as default on most corners.

When you opt in on using the sub themes, the border radius on widgets default
to the new rounded corners as specified by the
[Material 3 guide](https://m3.material.io/), where the
rounding varies by widget type. You can stick with this, or set global
radius to a value you prefer. You can also easily set the themed border
radius per widget and override the shared radius value in just a few cases. Use
simple property values per widget, no need for verbose custom sub theme
Shape definitions.
