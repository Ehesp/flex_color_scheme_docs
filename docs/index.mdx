## Introduction

Use **FlexColorScheme** to make beautiful color scheme based Flutter themes,
with optional primary color surface blends, or key color seeded schemes.
The themes are based on the same concept as Flutter's ColorScheme based themes,
with many additional features and a large number of pre-made themes.

When you color theme a Flutter application, all built-in widgets use the colors of the
`ColorScheme` in your theme. At least in theory, and it is almost so if you defined your
Flutter `ThemeData` by using the `ThemeData.from` factory, but even that
still misses a few details.

**FlexColorScheme** ensures that all Flutter SDK widgets gets themed completely by its
color schemes, or custom colors you provide. It also applies all the `ColorScheme` based colors
to all direct color properties in `ThemeData`, while they still exist, this
ensures that all the direct colors properties in `ThemeData` match your `ColorScheme`.

You can also opt-in on using opinionated component sub-themes.
By opting in, you can for example adjust the border radius on all UI widgets
with a single property to set the same themed border radius on all of them with
one property value. Current Flutter SDK widgets still default to being based on
the Material 2 design, and use 4 dp corner radius on most widgets.

When you opt-in on using the component sub-themes, the border radius on widgets
default to the new rounded corners as specified by the
[Material 3 guide](https://m3.material.io/), where the
radius varies by widget type. You can stick with this, or set the global widget
radius to a value you prefer. You can also easily set the themed border
radius per widget, and override the M3 default or global radius value you set.

With **FlexColorScheme** sub-themes you use simple flat component property values.
No need for verbose Flutter SDK component sub-themes with complicated `ShapeBorder`
definitions to change the border radius. The component sub-theming provides a
large amount of easy to configure options via simple flat properties,
instead of complicated nested ones, or the very complicated `MaterialState`
callback properties.

**FlexColorScheme** also has many advanced coloring features, like using
surface alpha blends. It also fully supports Material 3 based color schemes,
including seed key color generated `ColorSchemes`. It offers many configuration
options that you can use when you generate your `ColorScheme` from
key colors, features that are currently not directly available in Flutter.
