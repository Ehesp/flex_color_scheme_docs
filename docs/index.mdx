<Info>A beta release of FlexColorScheme 7.0.0 is available on pub.dev as [7.0.0-dev.2](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/7.0.0-dev.2), it supports new Material 3 features in [Flutter stable 3.7.0](https://medium.com/flutter/whats-new-in-flutter-3-7-38cbea71133c). A compatible Themes Playground app can be used as a [web tool here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v7). See more details in [what's new](/whats_new) chapter.</Info>

Use **FlexColorScheme** to make beautiful color scheme based Flutter Material design themes. Apply optional surface blends, or use Material 3 style seeded color schemes. The returned themes are standard `ThemeData` objects, but **very** sophisticated ones. They are based on the same idea as Flutter's `ThemeData.from(ColorScheme)` themes, but with many additional features. Choose from numerous pre-made designs or make your own. You can also use optional component sub theming, that are quick and easy to configure.

When you theme a Flutter application correctly, all built-in widgets use the colors of the `ColorScheme` in your theme. At least in theory, and it is almost so if you defined your `ThemeData` by using the `ThemeData.from` factory, but it misses a few details.

**FlexColorScheme** ensures that all Flutter SDK UI components get themed completely by its color schemes and custom colors you provide. It applies effective `ColorScheme` colors to all color properties in `ThemeData`. This ensures that all the direct colors properties in `ThemeData` match your `ColorScheme`. There are no surprises in `ThemeData` that do not match your `ColorScheme`.

You can opt in on using opinionated component sub-themes. By doing so, you can, for example, adjust the border radius on all UI widgets with a single property value. Flutter's Material UI widgets still default to the Material 2 design, and thus use 4 dp corner radius on most widgets.

When you opt in on using the component sub-themes, border radius on widgets defaults to the new Material 3 rounded corner design. In it, the radius varies by widget type, as specified by the [Material 3 guide](https://m3.material.io/). You can keep this or set the shared global widget radius to a value you prefer. You can also easily set the themed border radius per widget, and override the Material 3 default or the global radius value you defined.

You can also opt in on using Material 3. The Material 3 mode component sub-theming is far less opinionated, using mostly Material 3 defaults. One could say that opting in on using FlexColorScheme component sub themes, is a way of getting a Material 2 mode design, of Material 3, in Flutter. In Flutter 3.3 and earlier, using Material 3 design is still incomplete and also has many issues. Please refer to the docs for more information on the status of known problematic [Material 3 issues](https://docs.flexcolorscheme.com/known_issues) in Flutter.

With **FlexColorScheme** component themes, you use simple flat property values. No need for verbose Flutter SDK component sub-themes, with `ShapeBorder` definitions on multiple widget themes to change their border radius. The component theming provides a large number of easy to configure options via simple flat properties. In many cases you can avoid the both complicated and confusing `MaterialState` theming properties.

**FlexColorScheme** has many advanced coloring features, like using surface alpha blends. It also fully supports Material 3 based color schemes, including seed generated `ColorSchemes`. It offers different configuration options that you can use when you generate your `ColorScheme` from
key colors. Customization features that are currently not available in Flutter. This includes using multiple key colors as seeds, custom minimum chroma levels and customized tone mapping to ColorScheme colors.
