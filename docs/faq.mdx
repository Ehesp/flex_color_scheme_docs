# Frequently Asked Questions

Below some frequently asked question and answers about using FlexColorScheme.

## Custom color schemes?

A `FlexColorScheme` based theme, can like Flutter's standard `ColorScheme`
based theme be created by specifying all the required color scheme colors.
However, with `FlexColorScheme`
you can also specify only the primary color and get all other colors needed
for a complete color scheme computed based the given primary color.

There is a helper class `FlexSchemeColor`, with a factory called
`FlexSchemeColor.from`, it can create complete color schemes from
incomplete color scheme data. Additionally, its `toDark` method can create a
computed matching dark scheme from a defined light scheme.

These features are useful when you quickly want to test a single color, or maybe
only a primary and secondary color for a light theme, and get all other scheme
colors computed. When you figure out the colors you want, you can use exactly
tuned color definitions and make your custom color schemes from const values
instead. Using different ways to create custom color schemes is presented in
detail in the tutorial examples 2, 3 and 4.

And you can also use the live version of example 5, the
[Themes Playground](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut5) to copy
existing color schemes and modify them
interactively and copy the code for a theme, either custom one or all
the setups you made for a built-in one.

## Can I add custom sub themes?

When you make a theme with `FlexThemeData.light` or `dark`, it returns a normal
Flutter `ThemeData` object that you can use like any other `ThemeData` object.
You can then use this returned `ThemeData` and add
additional custom sub theming to it with `ThemeData`'s normal `copyWith` method,
before passing it on to your application's `theme` or `darkTheme` properties.

If you need color values that `FlexColorScheme` has created, maybe some auto
calculated main colors, but more typically the blended surface and on surface
colors for your sub themes, you can get them too. For this advanced use case,
it is recommended to use FlexColorScheme with the factory constructor
`FlexColorScheme.light` and `FlexColorScheme.dark`, to create the
`FlexColorScheme` objects first. Then get the `ColorScheme` they define
with its `toScheme` method, and use this `ColorScheme` data as input to your
custom sub theme creation.

When you make sub themes, you often need access to the colors their main
`ThemeData` is using and storing in its `colorScheme` property. This step
gives you that before even creating the `ThemeData` object from your
FlexColorScheme object. You can then Pass the `ColorScheme` you got
from `toScheme`, or just one or some of its
color values, along to your methods that define your sub theme data.

Using these steps you can turn your FlexColorScheme to `ThemeData` with its
`toTheme` method, and then add your sub themes with `copyWith` to this
object in the same go, since they now use the same `ColorScheme` colors, that
the ThemeData created with `toTheme` will get as as well.

You can of course also create the FlexColorScheme `ThemeData` with the
extensions `FlexThemeData.light` and `dark`, and get the `ColorScheme`
object from the ThemeData `colorScheme` property. Then use that color
scheme to create your sub-themes that need access to those color values.
Finally, use `copyWith` to create a new `ThemeData` with your custom sub themes
included. This is however one extra step and additional ThemeData object
compared to the other approach.

If you are creating modifications to a sub-theme that FlexColorScheme already
defines, **and** you want to keep the properties it has assigned. For example
only override a few property values in such a sub theme, then you will indeed
need to first create the `FlexColorScheme` based `ThemeData` object. Use the
sub theme from it that you want to add a modified copy of, as input to the
new `ThemeData`. In such a case you might as well use `FlexThemeData.light`
and `dark` API, since there is no win in the steps by first creating
the `FlexColorScheme` object.

If you are not opting in on the opinionated sub themes, this applies to the
following sub themes that are not null even in the vanilla FlexColorScheme
based `ThemeData`:

- `ThemeData.appBarTheme`
- `ThemeData.bottomAppBarTheme`
- `ThemeData.tabBarTheme`
- `ThemeData.inputDecorationTheme`
- `ThemeData.textSelectionTheme`
- `ThemeData.tooltipTheme`
- `ThemeData.buttonTheme` (for the legacy deprecated buttons)
- `ThemeData.chipTheme`
- `ThemeData.bottomNavigationBarTheme`

The changes made in the above vanilla FlexColorScheme based `ThemeData`
sub themes are pretty small, but the themes are not null. You can read more
about what changes `FlexColorScheme` makes to them in this
["Inside FlexColorScheme" document (external link)](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/INSIDE.md).

When you opt in on using the opinionated sub themes in version 4, the above
sub themes are typically further modified. Additionally, the following sub
themes are also no longer null, which they are in the vanilla version:

- `ThemeData.iconTheme`
- `ThemeData.primaryIconTheme`
- `ThemeData.textButtonTheme`
- `ThemeData.elevatedButtonTheme`
- `ThemeData.outlinedButtonTheme`
- `ThemeData.toggleButtonsTheme`
- `ThemeData.floatingActionButtonTheme`
- `ThemeData.cardTheme`
- `ThemeData.popupMenuTheme`
- `ThemeData.dialogTheme`
- `ThemeData.timePickerTheme`
- `ThemeData.snackBarTheme`
- `ThemeData.bottomSheetTheme`
- `ThemeData.navigationBarTheme`

If you want to add custom sub-themes and keep the already existing modified
properties in `ThemeData` intact, you cannot use just a `copyWith` using
a sub theme constructor. You have to use the sub-theme instance from
the current `ThemeData`, and the `copyWith` on it, assign it to the sub theme
in the `copyWith` on the `ThemeData`. This is the same way that you
would modify `ThemeData` when you create scoped ThemeData inside your
app, and want it to fully inherit the parent Theme, but with a few
properties modified in some sub themes only. This sounds more complicated
than it is.

To make it easier to follow, here is an example of what this looks like.
Say you want to modify shadow color of the `appBarTheme` in `ThemeData`,
but you also want to keep all the other theme changes FlexColorScheme has
introduced to it, like e.g. using surface color with a blend of primary as
its background color, if you have chosen that mode for the `AppBar` theme.
You can then add your shadow color like this:


```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final ThemeData lightTheme = FlexThemeData.light(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed);
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: lightTheme.copyWith(appBarTheme: lightTheme.appBarTheme.copyWith(
           shadowColor: const Color(0xFFFFFFFF));
      themeMode: ThemeMode.light,
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}
```

This is still a bit involved. I might look into the possibility of providing
deepCopyWith methods, at least for the first sub theme level, in a
future version. Some kind of `deepCopyWith` method for sub-themes would be
really handy to even have in the Flutter SDK on `ThemeData`.

One additional possibility when creating totally custom sub-themes is to utilize the
static helper functions in the `FlexSubThemes` class. FlexColorScheme uses
them internally to create the sub themes in version 4.
You can find its API documentation [here](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemes-class.html).
Some of them offer simplified APIs for setting and using more involved features
in its standard SDK sub-theme. You can also use them to check out
how a particular design is implemented if you want to replicate it in a standard
Flutter SDK sub-theme.

You can of course also use these sub theming functions to make custom
sub-themes, and even complement them with `copyWith` values for properties
they do not provide. Please note
that the `FlexSubThemes` static helper functions are not meant to provide
all properties for all existing sub themes. They only cover the properties
and shortcut features needed by `FlexColorScheme`. When using `FlexColorScheme`
you typically use the `FlexSubThemesData` configuration class, passed in to
`FlexColorScheme.subThemesData` property, as a convenient way to configure
and customize them in one go.


## If I don't use the predefined Schemes, why should I use FlexColorScheme?

The purposes with the FlexColorScheme package is to:

* Fixes some odd things in Flutter's standard ThemeData definitions and make
  all SDK Widgets, old, new and even deprecated ones, use the specified color
  scheme in the expected way.
* Enable easy switching among multiple color schemes in an app.
* Provide an easy way to make themes with primary color branded and blended
  backgrounds and surfaces. Be able to easily vary the blend level and mode
  for different surfaces.
* Provide a quick toggle for different `AppBar` styles, without the need to
  manually make a custom theme for it every time, including matching `TabBar`.
* Provide optional support for a true black mode for dark themes.
* Quickly swap the primary and secondary color definitions, if you
  want to try your theme the other way around.
* Theme the Android System navigation bar to match your app theme, and make it
  partially or totally transparent.
* With default settings FlexColorScheme avoids touching the Widget sub-theme
  definitions, but in a few cases it is needed to fix things and to make some
  minor design changes. In the default produced ThemeData the changes are as few
  and subtle as possible, leaving the task of Widget sub theming more up to you.
  However, you can also opt in on widget sub themes to get a more refined and
  opinionated look on widgets and used text theme. The defaults for
  the new opt in sub themes are inspired by the new
  [Material 3 guide](https://m3.material.io/). Following it when it can easily
  be accomplished by using the Material 2 based theming in Flutter. Full
  support for Material 3 widgets and themes is coming to Flutter later.
* FlexColorScheme also provides a way to make "lazy" quick toned `ColorScheme`
  themes from just a single light scheme color. Even its dark scheme
  counterpart can be made from this single color definition.

If you like the above features, then FlexColorScheme may fit your theming
requirements, even if you do not use any of its built-in color schemes.

## Can we change this predefined scheme's colors?

No, current predefined schemes will not be changed. Changing them would be a
breaking change to the package version promise. The scheme colors could in theory
be changed by releasing a new major version that break past scheme color
definitions. At the moment, there are no plans to ever add breaking releases
to just change a predefined scheme's color(s). All current color definition
values are also included in the package tests, and a failed color value test is
considered a breaking design change.

## Can we add this scheme?

To keep things interesting, there will from time to time be new color schemes
added to the package. If you have a beautiful color scheme with matching light
and dark theme mode colors, that you think would be perfect to include, then
please post a suggestion as a GitHub issue.

No promise is made about its eventual inclusion, but if it is a nice,
unique, and overall a pretty color scheme, it will likely be included.
Coming up with nice color schemes is trickier than it seems,
suggestions and contributions to new ones are very welcome.

## Can I use different built-in color schemes for my light and dark themes?

Yes this is possible. Use different `FlexScheme` enum values for the light
and dark `FlexThemeData.light` and `FlexThemeData.dark` factories' `scheme`
property. If the colors used by the selected schemes are a bit related, this
can be used to create nice and unique light and dark combinations of
the predefined schemes.

By using the `colors` property you could even apply a `FlexSchemeColor` that
has data that was designed for a light theme, to the `FlexThemeData.dark` factory,
and wise versa. For example, using the `FlexThemeData.dark` factory, you could
to its `colors` property assign the `FlexSchemeColors` from
`FlexColor.schemes[FlexScheme.mandyRed].light` that are designed and intended
to be used with the light mode factory.

The results will typically not be very useful or pretty. The rationale for
the slightly involved data structure, is to keep it flexible, but at the same
time provide self documenting API guidance on how the data was designed to be
used and consumed.

The `scheme` property prevents using the light scheme colors for the dark
factory and wise versa. It can however be done if so desired by using the
`colors` property as explained above. The `colors` property is always needed and
used when you make custom color schemes using the `FlexThemeData.light` and
`FlexThemeData.dark` factories.
