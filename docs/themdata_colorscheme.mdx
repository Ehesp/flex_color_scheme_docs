# ThemeData

The Flutter `ThemeData` object is a very large theme style and behavior controlling data class. It can change the look and feel of your Flutter application completely. It is not really that difficult to use, but it has many quirks and oddities, especially when it comes to colors. This is mostly due to past legacy and things that were not considered early on. Some parts were done differently first, later things changed, but those earlier ways are still supported in order to not break past behavior.

With many new ways to define and setup colors added later, it can all become a bit confusing. This is further amplified since the official documentation, and most theming guides, still use the old factories that do not produce nicely colored and color-consistent themes.

When you make themed Flutter applications, you should base the colors of your application on a light theme mode suitable `ColorScheme`, and a dark theme mode suitable `ColorScheme`. Then create your light and dark `ThemeData` using these color schemes, by assigning the `ColorScheme` for each mode to the `colorScheme`
property in `ThemeData`.

In your `MaterialApp` you then assign the `ThemeData` for your light, and dark theme to the `theme` and `darkTheme` properties respectively in the `MaterialApp`.

```dart
void main() => runApp(const DemoApp());

class DemoApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const DemoApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: 'Custom ThemeData',
      theme: ThemeData(colorScheme: schemeLight),
      darkTheme: ThemeData(colorScheme: schemeDark),
      themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}
```

### Legacy Complexity

In theory, this gives you an application that uses the defined color schemes on all the Flutter SDK built-in Material UI widgets. Well it should, and it almost does, especially if you used Flutter's `ThemeData.from` a `ColorScheme` factory. However, even it has issues. The used color scheme is not consistently applied on all built-in Flutter SDK Material UI Widgets. To get it completely covered, you also have to assign a few colors from your `ColorScheme` to a few color properties that still only exist as direct color properties in `ThemeData`. The situation is a lot better when your `ThemeData` sets `useMaterial3: true`, but it is not perfect either.

This is all further complicated by the fact that under the hood some Flutter SDK UI widgets still use the original direct color properties in `ThemeData`. These properties are now mostly assigned color values via `ThemeData.colorScheme`. Exactly which colors will end up where, depends on which `ThemeData` factory constructor you use. The factory `ThemeData.from` does the best job when `useMaterial3` is false. When it is true vanilla `ThemeData` factory works reasonably well and uses mostly the same assignments as if the `from` factory had been used. Still there are issues in M3 mode as well, some related to legacy and some to new issues.

Some older components still do not use the `ThemeData.colorScheme` properties for their default color values directly, they still use color property values from `ThemeData`, that may have gotten values assigned from `ThemeData.colorScheme`, this behavior varies depending on used `ThemeData` creation factory!

Very basic and old widgets, like for example `Material` and `Card` fall into the category of widgets that actually still use `ThemeData` color properties as their default color values in M2 mode. While some newer widgets use colors from `ThemeData.colorScheme` directly. Additionally, the colors in the `ColorScheme` held by the `colorScheme` property in `ThemeData` can actually not represent all the colors that exist in `ThemeData`'s color properties. Thus, some color properties never get any `ColorScheme` based values assigned to them in M2 or M3 mode. They are left to default values assigned by the `ThemeData` factory, unless you explicitly assign them color values that fit with your color scheme. If this is not done, it can then look odd if some widgets, or your app uses these colors and get the factory default colors, while the rest of your app's typically use the `ColorScheme` based colors.

Luckily there are not so many widgets left that this mess still applies to, but there are a few, for example `CircleAvatar` in M2 mode. It can all be confusing and a bit frustrating to fight with `ThemeData` and its direct color properties. If not done correctly, it may result in themes with color schemes that are not entirely consistent or logical across all standard SDK widgets in your application. Even more so if you expect `ThemeData` colors like `primaryColor`, `primaryColorLight` and `primaryColorDark` be derived from your `colorScheme.primary` color, that is just not always the case.

In the chapter [Roads to ThemeData](/theming_roads) we will look at all the different ways to define a `ThemeData` object. We will then see different results, like the ones below.

<Info>Depending on how we create our `ThemeData`, the results can vary a lot, even if we use the same input colors.</Info>


### Light and Dark Themes

In some older apps and theming guides you might see setups where the light and dark themes are both assigned to `theme` in `MaterialApp`, by using a ternary operator based on desired `Brightness` to select used `ThemeData`. Don't do this!

<Error>Do not use ternary operator to switch between a light `ThemeData` and dark one, on only the `theme` property in `MaterialApp`.</Error>

This is something that was used before there was a `darkTheme` property in the `MaterialApp`. Prefer to assign your theme mode appropriate `ThemeData` to the correct properties in the `MaterialApp`.

If your app does not offer a way to toggle the theme mode via the `themeMode` property, then keep `themeMode` at its default `ThemeMode.system`, so that the app theme automatically follows the device theme mode.

If you do offer a way to override and set the app to light or dark theme independently of the system settings, then always also include in the settings, an option to use the system mode that follows the system setting too. This should even be your default value for it. Now you have covered all options, and users can set the theme mode as they prefer.

### High-Contrast Themes

The `ThemeData` assignment also applies to the `highContrastTheme` and `highContrastDarkTheme` theme. If your app has dedicated designs for high-contrast accessibility themes, do assign them to these properties. These properties are all there to give you the right device system settings driven behavior. So your app can follow the device system theme mode and its high-contrast accessibility settings.

<Warning>Currently, only iOS platform in Flutter supports system settings based switching to theme provided via the `highContrastTheme` and `highContrastDarkTheme` theme properties.</Warning>

### ThemeData Deprecations

There is a Flutter development plan in progress to **deprecate most** direct color properties in the `ThemeData` class. Flutter SDK widgets will after that only use `ColorScheme` based colors that are in the ThemeData `colorScheme` property, as default colors for colors on their elements.

This design [document](https://flutter.dev/go/material-theme-system-updates) describes the plan and reasoning. There is also a color property deprecation check list in [issue 91772](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91772) to mirror this plan. It has taken a while, but there is activity and progress being made continuously in the Flutter master channel. Many of them have already dropped into stable releases.

For **FlexColorScheme** the progress of these actions is monitored closely. Needed changes and updates to FlexColorScheme are always implemented when relevant changes in `ThemeData` reach the Flutter stable channel. The typical maintenance need is removing deprecated `ThemeData` properties and to check if some new sub-theme color property needs to be modified or added, in order to replicate past **FlexColorScheme** theming behavior, when its corresponding color property is removed from `ThemeData`.

## ThemeData factories

There are 6 different constructors in Flutter to make a `ThemeData` object. All constructors of `ThemeData` except the `ThemeData.raw` are factory constructors. This is why they are not `const` and why they can execute different logic and produce very different results that driven by conditions and complex logic based on what properties you provided.

This is nice, but it also big source of confusion, as the factory contrustors contain lot of logic to deal with legacy ways in none breaking manners with past methods.

### `ThemeData.raw(...)`

This is the actual const constructor of the `ThemeData` object. It requires all its none deprecated properties to be specified. Normally you would not use this constructor directly. It is of course possible to do so, but very tedious.


### `ThemeData(...)` 

This is the main factory used to construct a `ThemeData` object. This is the only practical constructor to use if you also want to modify a lot of properties, even if it is just to correct some of the things it does not do very well. It contains a lot of logic dealing with color assignments, constructing the text themes, etc. It ends by assigning all its results to all the properties in `ThemeData.raw(...)` and returning it.


### `ThemeData.light(...)`
  
This just returns `ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.light)` with the optional `useMaterial3` flag set to **true** or **false**. Not really a big shortcut, you might as well use `ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.light)` and have the convenience of adding other properties when needed. I don't know why this API exists, it is not needed.


### `ThemeData.dark(...)`

This just returns `ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.dark)` with the optional `useMaterial3` flag set to **true** or **false**. If `useMaterial3` is **false**, this factory and consequently also the version `ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.dark)` returns a **horrible** looking dark theme. It is a grey dark theme, not really dark at all. This dark theme is also not following the **Material 2** dark mode specification. This theme is based on a poor Flutter dark theme implementation and default that was made before it implemented a way to make an actually decent looking Material 2 dark mode theme. **DO NOT** use this if you want a decent looking dark theme when `useMaterial3` is **false**. If `useMaterial3` is **true**, it produces a decent default dark mode theme suitable for Material 3.

As with its `light` companion, this factory is not really a big shortcut, you might as well use `ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.light)` and have the convenience of adding other properties when needed. I don't know why this API exists, it is not needed and its result when `useMaterial3` is false is mostly useless.


### `ThemeData.fallback(...)`
  
This is defined as `factory ThemeData.fallback({bool? useMaterial3}) => ThemeData.light(useMaterial3: useMaterial3);`. It is used in some cases by the framework to guarantee a none null valid default fallback `ThemeData` object. If you are not writing a theming package, you probably won't need it.  


### `ThemeData.from(...)`
  
This factory creates a `ThemeData` from the passed in `ColorScheme` using better logic than `ThemeData` normally uses when `useMaterial3` flag is set to **false**. Better, here refers to that colors for the `ColorScheme` are applied to important legacy colors in the direct `ThemeData` color properties. This ensures that many Material 2 widgets and surfaces will actually use the colors in the `ColorsScheme`. Ideally, this factory should not be needed either. It was added to not break what happened when you just pass in a `ColorScheme` to the `colorScheme` property in the `ThemeData` factory. For less confusion it would have been better the break the past result when passing in a `ColorScheme` to `ThemeData` factory and instead introduce the result the `ThemeData.from` produces, into it when a `colorScheme` is assigned.

Ironically when you set `useMaterial3` to true, in plain the vanilla `ThemeData` factory, it does mostly the same assignments to the required direct color properties in `ThemeData`. It does it for passed in colorScheme, seed generated scheme or default theme, that the `ThemeData.from` factory does in M2 mode. There are some minor differences that are actually probably oversight bugs. See issue [Divider Color Inconsistencies #117755](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/117755) for more information. 
 
This better theming result from the `ThemeData.from(...)` a `ColorScheme` factory, is not without issues either. To get even better results, you will need to fix some colors anyway. You will need to do this in both M2 and M3 mode, but much less in M3 mode. The need for this makes the `ThemeData.from(...)` factory pretty pointless, even if it for Material 2 and Material 3 produces the best results. Still, it is better to learn how to apply the things it does correctly, then apply them yourself with vanilla `ThemeData` factory, and at the same time correct the things it does not do so well. Plus at the same time you can apply all other theming customizations that only the `ThemeData` factory provides. In this guide we will later show how to make a correctly `ColorScheme` colored `ThemeData` with the vanilla `ThemeData` factory.

## ColorScheme constructors

The `ColorScheme` in `ThemeData`, provides the colors to all the different elements in all UI widgets. As mentioned in previous chapter, default color mappings are based on Material 2 and Material 3 specifications. Which default color mapping and other default value specification gets used, is based on the `ThemeData(useMaterial3: true/false)` property, it defaults to false. The `ColorScheme` class contains 30 different color properties, to get a good M2 and M3 `ColorScheme` best results are achieved when colors are applied that follow the respective Material version's color system guidelines, for every color property in the `ColorScheme` that it uses. 

Defining 30 colors for each theme mode `ColorScheme` that follow the M2 or M3 guidelines is no small task. Threfore in addition to the default constructor `ColorScheme(...)` there are factories that can help you create M2/M3 mode suitable `ColorScheme`s. We go though them briefly below. 

### `ColorScheme(...)`

This is the default `const` constructor, you can use it to construct a `ColorScheme` manually suitable a theme that uses either M2 or M3. It requires 10 of its 30 properties to be defined. The rest of the color properties will use the given required properties as fallbacks to give them appropriate, but not necessary ideal color values from the required values. This constructor offers no default or help in defining the `ColorScheme`. It is often used if you have used external tooling that have generated the `ColorScheme` for you, fully populated with all its `Color` values. 


### `ColorScheme.light(...)`
 
This `const` constructor will give you a default **Material-2** based light theme mode `ColorScheme` if you do specify any color values. It includes the M2 correct, `surface`, `background`, `error` colors and contrasting **onColors** for them. It also has default for `primary`, `onPrimary`, `secondary` and `onSecondary` colors. You can override these color values with your M2 theme colors. To make a correct custom M2 `ColorScheme` you only need to specify those 4 colors, often not even the onColors, if your `primary` and `secondary` colors happen to have the same brightness as the M2 defaults. You can override any of the defaults and also assign color values to all the other color properties, although, when using M2 theme mode, the colors are not used by default by UI widgets. You can of course still use them in M2-mode as custom theme-accessible colors, and also use them as custom colors default colors in component themes.

You can also manually create M3 compatible `ColorScheme` with this constructor, but it does not help you anymore than the default constructor ColorScheme(...)` does, basically not at all.

 
### `ColorScheme.dark(...)`
 
This `const` constructor is the M2 default dark theme mode equivalent of `ColorScheme.light(...)`. Same usage guidance applies to it as for the light version.


### `ColorScheme.highContrastLight(...)`

This `const` constructor is an M2 equivalent of `ColorScheme.light(...)` but with default fallback colors that offer higher contrast than `ColorScheme.light(...)`, it is used as an example of making a theme with higher contrast for improved visual accessibility. 


### `ColorScheme.highContrastDark(...)`

  This is the dark mode equivalent of `ColorScheme.highContrastLight(...)`.


### `ColorScheme.fromSeed(...)`
 
This is the factory constructor you should use to create a **Material 3** Color System based `ColorScheme`. The Material 3 color system uses a new color space and algorithm developed by Google to calculate color palettes with visually consistent and pleasing color gradients. The color space is called HCT for Hue, Chroma and Tone. You can read more about it in the [Material-3 guide](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/overview). This developement blog post also offers more insights [add link]().

To create a `ColorScheme` you specify the `Brightness` of the scheme `light` (default) or `dark` and give it a `seedColor`. The seed color is your main color for the `ColorScheme`. It may often be you **brand** color. You should use the same `seedColor` values for both e light and dark `ColorScheme`. Do note that the `Color` used as `seedColor` will typically not end up as your `primary` color in the produced `ColorScheme`, which if it is your brand color you want. To get the brand color used as seed, to also be used as `primary` color you can give it as an override input to the factory, like `ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: brandColor, primary: lighBrandColor)`. That is it, you now have a light theme mode M3 color scheme using your brand color as primary color. The rest of the colors, will all match reasonably well with it, but you can also manually override all other colors in the seed color computed `ColorScheme`.

When you make your dark mode `ColorScheme` you would typically use the same color as the `lightBrandColor` used for the light scheme as the seed color in dark mode too. Companies generally only have brand colors intended to be printed on white paper, more seldom hand-picked brand colors for presentation on black/dark color that might be useful in an application's dark mode theme. 

* For the above, the most typical case use: `ColorScheme.fromSeed(brightness: Brightness.dark, seedColor: lightBrandColor)`
 
* If you have a dark mode brand color, it probably is a lighter tone of the one used on white paper. If that is the case, you should still use the light mode brand color to seed the dark mode `ColorScheme`, but use the dark mode intended brand color as `primary` color override. When you do that, you may also need to ensure that `onPrimary` has the correct contrast color for the `primary` override. Generally this should work well for this case: `ColorScheme.fromSeed(brightness: Brightness.dark, seedColor: lightBrandColor, primary: darkBrandColor)`. 
* For a correct M3 style theme, it is important to use the same seed color in the light and dark seed generated `ColorScheme`. If you don't care about M3 design spec and guidelines, you can certainly experiment with a totally different seed color and look in dark mode. 
   
* If there is a brand color for dark mode that has a totally different hue than the light mode brand color, then do use that as both seed and primary override color when making the dark mode scheme. Like this: `ColorScheme.fromSeed(brightness: Brightness.dark, seedColor: darkBrandColor, primary: darkBrandColor)`.


### `ColorScheme.fromSwatch(...)`

This is a very bad and old way of making a `ColorScheme` from a `MaterialColor` based color swatch. It produces horrific results by default in both light and dark mode. **Don't use it.** You will see and find out why later. If you want to make a `ColorScheme` from `MaterialColor` swatch colors, consider using any of the above constructors instead and assigning the required swatch colors to desired `ColorScheme` properties, in the way that fits your need. This factory constructor needs to be deprecated, it produces results that are totally useless.


### `SeedColorScheme.fromSeeds(...)` (Third party) 

To make a Material-3 mode compatible seed generated `ColorScheme`, with much more configuration options and control over the result than `ColorScheme.fromSeed(...)` offers, consider using the replacement `SeedColorScheme.fromSeeds(...)` from the package [FlexSeedScheme](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_seed_scheme). **FlexColorScheme** also uses this package internally to offer more control over seed generated color schemes.


## FlexColorScheme and ThemeData

At its core `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` only creates a `ThemeData` object. You can think of it as super fancy **ThemeData** factory. It helps you make a consistent `ColorScheme` based theme, and to produce a more refined Flutter `ThemeData` object. Since its output is a standard `ThemeData` object, you can adjust it further as much as desired by using normal `ThemeData.copyWith` on it and all its component themes. If some detail is not to your liking and its API does not support changing a particular part, you can still use it for everything else and just adjust that part in the result it produces with `copyWith`, before you assign it to you app's theme.

One of the fundamental things FlexColorScheme does, is that it fixes minor inconsistencies and gaps that exist with Flutter's `ThemeData` and `ThemeData.from` factories. It also handles the complexity of using the `ThemeData` factory directly. It releases you from the burden of knowing what colors in it affect which widgets how. The messy state of `ThemeData` and all its legacy is a more obvious issue in **Material 2** mode, when using the newer **Material 3** mode, the issues with poor defaults and colors not using **ColorScheme** colors are much fewer, but they still exist when it comes to some legacy colors in `ThemeData` and legacy widgets as well.

FlexColorScheme makes a few opinionated, but subtle theme modifications compared to the `ThemeData.from` themes created from a `ColorScheme`. By default, FlexColorScheme theming refrains from touching component theme properties not related to making the colors more consistent. Some minor adjustments are needed. This is covered in detail in the API guide section in [Core defaults](/core_defaults).

When you **opt in** on using its **opinionated component themes**, the story changes. It then does significant customization using Flutter's component themes if you are using **Material 2** mode. In fact, its **M2** mode emulates **M3** to a large degree when it comes to the border radius of widgets. When you use **Material 3** mode, and activate its **opinionated component themes** the components mostly default to **Material 3** defaults. Some component themes with a long legacy in **FlexColorScheme** have a slightly different style than **M3** defaults, in order to not break their past established FCS M2 mode styles that existed before the components supported **M3**. The **Themes Playground** offers some quick settings buttons to toggle such default to match **Material 3** default, when component themes are opted in on in FlexColorScheme. It is still useful to recall that both its M2 and M3 modes do come with some opinionated default style over M2 and M3 defaults, that said M2, and even more so M3, are both also very opinionated styles, the **Material** style.

The sub-theme definitions for both M2 and M3 component themes are still all done within the standard `ThemeData` object. FlexColorScheme cannot make themes that you cannot repeat yourself by defining the same `ThemeData` object and all its component themes manually.

It is, however, very tedious and verbose to do all the things it can do manually. Personally, I don't even attempt it anymore, even if I could. It is so much quicker and simpler to use **FlexColorScheme** to accomplish many of the complex theme definitions it does.
