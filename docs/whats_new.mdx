# What Is New?

This chapter features recent news and information about updates in **FlexColorScheme**. For a more complete list, and older updates, please refer to the package [changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/changelog).

## Version 7.0.0-dev.3

**March 18, 2023**

This is the final beta v7 release before stable v7 is out. There will be no new features or API changes in the FlexColorScheme package from this version to stable version 7.0.0. The only changes to stable will be potential bug fixes, typo corrections, API doc comment improvements and adding more tests.

The companion app **Themes Playground**, may get label improvements plus spelling and grammar corrections. Layouts in it may also be modified and improved as needed. It will not get any new features, but it may of course receive bug fixes.

The **Themes Playground** app built for this **beta** release is unfortunately not a SKIA renderer build, it is using the HTML renderer. This makes it less performant than the app would otherwise be. Additionally, scaled content, like the **Themes Simulator** panel in the **Playground**, is also fuzzier than it would be with the SKIA renderer. Due to an issue in Flutter stable (3.7.7), builds made with the SKIA renderer performs very poorly and crashes quite quickly. For more information see Flutter [issue #122189](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/122189). Hopefully, before the stable v7.0.0 release, a fix will be available. If not, a new build using the same package version will be made later and released when a fix is available.

**Why version 7.0.0? Are there breaking APIs?**

There are a few minor breaking APIs in version 7 compared to version 6. Most likely you will not run into them. However, some past styles and defaults have been slightly tuned to align things better with M3. For a detailed list of changes from version 7.0.0-dev.2 to this final beta 7.0.0-dev.3, please see the [package changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/7.0.0-dev.3/changelog), the number of new features in **FlexColorScheme** and **Themes Playground** from previous beta are significant.  

**Twelve new ColorSchemes**

FCS v7 includes theming support for new Material 3 widgets in Flutter 3.7. It also comes with **12 new M3 ColorScheme themes**, for a **total of 52**, so now it holds all the cards. The additional color schemes can be used as such, and provide a good M3 color system fit as they are. For an even better M3 aligned style, enable seeded ColorScheme in FlexColorScheme. They work well with only primary key color as seed, but are also tuned to work if you enable their secondary and tertiary colors as key colors for seeding the ColorScheme. For a more conservative seed-generated ColorScheme, do not use secondary color as a seed color. This applies generally to seeded ColorScheme generation.

**Flexible Seeded ColorSchemes**

You can customize how the seeded ColorScheme is generated from key colors. The default option is the Material 3 and Flutter standard `ColorScheme.fromSeed` used settings, but FCS allows you to completely customize how it behaves. To ease the burden of trying this, it comes with many preconfigured options. A new thing is that if you use a custom surface blend color in FCS surface color blending. This same color is now used as seed for the neutral colors (surfaces and backgrounds) when you use M3 ColorScheme seed generation. Normally, in M3 default design, the primary color is always used for the slightly tinted surface colors. With FCS, you can now customize this to any other color. Go easy on it though, not everything will look good. But you can certainly create interesting unique looking apps with it.

**Platform Adaptive Themes**

An exciting new feature, FlexColorScheme now supports something it calls **platform adaptive themes**. This means that there are a few features and properties that can have a platform adaptive response. You can, for example, give your apps widget a different general border radius on iOS and macOS, and still keep M3 styles on Android. There are not so many platform adaptive properties in this release, but they hit where it counts to make it possible to make Material 3 mode less opinionated on e.g. iOS. For each platform adaptive feature, you can completely customize on what platform the adaptive optional theming value should be used. Each platform's web usage is also considered as a separate platform. Learn more about this feature in the API docs about the [FlexAdaptive](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/7.0.0-dev.3/flex_color_scheme/FlexAdaptive-class.html) class used to configure when the adaptive behavior for each platform adaptive setting gets applied.

**Color expressive interaction and disabled controls**

For some combinations of colors, M3 does a decent job of making interactions like pressed, focus, hovered, more color expressive than before. But for some widgets, M3 does not do so. Also, when you deviate in color choices for widgets from defaults, especially if their brightness is different, interaction effects may become invisible or too weak. With FlexColorScheme you can use more consistently color expressive interaction effects, and you can also separately opt-in on, color tinted disabled controls. These changes are often quite subtle, and give you a more refined consistently color expressive theme. On larger surface areas, like clickable [ListTile] the differences are much more obvious. 

**Support for new M3 Components**

The new filled and tonal buttons are now available. The theming capabilities of these new buttons are a bit limited. Theming their colors, changes the colors of both buttons and you no longer get two different button styles. This is a [limitation](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/115827) in current version of Flutter. The situation may be improved in later Flutter versions. I recommend keeping their colors as they are. Changing other parts of their theme in sync, like e.g. border radius is often desired, so that is still usable. Together with **Elevated**, **Outlined** and **Text** buttons, you now get a pretty complete button set out of the box, using most of the common colors in the ColorScheme.

The new menus are one of my personal favorites in Flutter 3.7. The same underlying component is used for the menu in `DropDownMenu`, `MenuBar` and `MenuAnchor`. We now have a lovely dropdown menu in Flutter. The `MenuBar` is great for desktop apps, it supports nested menus and keyboard shortcuts deep into the nested menus. The `MenuAnchor` is like one menu from a `MenuBar` that you can attach to any widget. Common use case could be right- or control-click context menus. For the new menus, FCS7 offers quite extensive theming options. There are some still some styling limitations due to a few lacking features and bugs in Flutter, but a lot can be done to them already. 

The `DropdownMenu` has a `TextField` input part, it follows the general `TextField` input decoration you defined in FCS. In version 7 there are more quick config options available for the `TextField` and its `InputDecoratior`. Another neat synergy with menus is that for the menu options in the bar and the menu selections, the same `ButtonStyle` button that the normal Material button use is used as their building block. If you are familiar with raw custom theming the `ButtonStyle` Material buttons, with their complex but versatile MaterialState, you already know how to theme menu selection options. 

**Themes Playground v7**

There are many other new components and configurable component sub-theme settings in FCS7 for you to explore. You can do so easily in version 7 of the [Themes Playground](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v7).

Version 7 of the **Themes Playground** has so many new and exciting features that its chapter will need to be completely rewritten. Things like:

* **Premade designs**: Use them to learn more about what FlexColorScheme can do and as starting points for your theme designs. The premade designs do not change the used color scheme. They only change how widget designs, like which colors from the color scheme they use, their border radius, is adaptive feature used, is seeding used or not, etc.
 
* **Theme preview**: Use this to see how your design looks on few built-in example applications. You can try them on different devices. One of the built-in examples is the official Material-3 demo app from the Flutter team. When you change your theme design, the demo apps are modified according as well.

* **New layouts**: The page view is now much more useful. You can choose which two panels you want to see side-by-side. Great for checking how a setting impacts things in API code, or on colors, or the design of the demo apps. There is also a **compact** mode for smaller desktops, so you can see more of the things that matters. Great if you are not using a 4k monitor at native resolution.

**Future of Themes Playground**

The **Themes Playground** is example number 5 in the package repository, originally included as the last step in a "how to use FlexColorScheme" training tutorial. Since its humble introduction it has grown into a notable and quite extensive application of its own, and is too extensive to serve as a very helpful tutorial step anymore. Despite having many advanced and useful features as a companion application to the **FlexColorScheme** package, it is architecturally identical to steps and examples 3 and 4 in the tutorial.

The application has an architecture that is a bit too simplistic to be extended to offer all features users are asking for. There is a plan to refactor it and make it into a proper stand-alone application developed in its own repo. This is potentially the last major release of the **Themes Playground** in its current form, and as being included with the **FlexColorScheme** package as "just an example" of how to use the package to build a dynamically themed app, which is how it started. It will still remain in minor and fix versions of v7, but will likely be removed in a future v8 version of the **FlexColorScheme** package.

As a tutorial and example app, the **Themes Playground** has never had any functional guarantees or even any tests at all of its own. This is still the case. The **FlexColorScheme** package has and always aims for 100% test coverage in its stable releases.

Despite **Themes Playground** not having any formal guarantees, it is extensively used and user tested during development of **FlexColorScheme** releases. In addition to being a very useful tool to configure and experiment with different themes for Flutter apps, and to quickly copy needed API configuration to get the same theme in your app. It is also an excellent tool to use during development of the **FlexColorScheme** package. It is used to visually see and verify that all features in the package **actually** do what is expected of them. The changes to the **Themes Playground** app are also generally already quite thoroughly tracked, going back many releases. Changes to version v7.0.0-dev.3, from v7.0.0-dev.2 can be found the [package changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/7.0.0-dev.3/changelog).

## Version 6.1.0

**FlexColorScheme** version 6.1.0 contains many new features, more component sub-themes and configurable properties. It improves seed-generated color scheme capabilities by adding more pre-configured seed generation configurations and color contrast accessibility options.

A criticism of Material 3's color system and seed-generated color schemes, is that using colored contrasting colors may be less accessible. FlexColorScheme offers a way to enable in-app modification of its M3-style seed-generated color schemes. Any seed generation configuration can optionally return results with plain white and black contrasting on colors. This can be applied separately for main on colors and surface on colors.

The **Themes Playground** application, has been updated to include most of the new features. It has been improved to make it easier to discover some of its previously existing features, like using custom colors in the Playground to define your own theme.

Some minor style changes exist when opting in on opinionated component sub-themes, they bring the Material 2 mode component themes closer in alignment with Material 3 styles. For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the [package changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/changelog).

## Version 6.0.0

This is a **breaking** release. For a complete list of all changes, see [change log](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/6.0.0/changelog). Generated [API docs](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/flex_color_scheme-library.html) are available and up to date with version 6. This release **requires** at least **Flutter 3.3.0** and **Dart 2.18.0**. It uses theming features in Flutter SDK that do not exist in earlier versions.

**BREAKING**

* **FlexColorScheme** no longer directly depends on package [Material Color Utilities package](https://pub.dev/packages/material_color_utilities), which is also used by Flutter SDK. Instead, it uses package [FlexSeedScheme](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_seed_scheme) that depends on it. As a part of this change classes `FlexTones`, `FlexTonalPalette` and `FlexCorePalette` where moved into the package **FlexSeedScheme**. FlexColorScheme still exports these classes. If you were using them directly before, you can still do so without adding the FlexSeedScheme package.
  * In **FlexSeedScheme**, `FlexTones` contains a minor breaking change to make the API cleaner. The `FlexTones.light` and `FlexTones.dark` no longer produce the config for the Material 3 tone and chroma setup. They no longer lock the chroma values to the default values for M3, but use null in their configs for their chroma values. Resulting in that chroma from key colors will be used, as long as they are over set minimum values.
  * In **FlexSeedScheme** `FlexCorePalette.fromSeeds` properties `secondaryChroma` and `tertiaryChroma` now default to null instead of previous M3 palette default generating values 16 and 24 respectively. Set them to values 16 and 24 to create same tonal palettes as Material Color Utilities `CorePalette` and previous versions of `FlexCorePalette`.
  * To allow for greater flexibility, and for the addition of tonal palette tones 5 (custom for FCS) and 98 (Google Material 3 Web theme builder app includes tone 98 to, but not Flutter SDK), `FlexCorePalette` no longer extends `CorePalette`, it is a modified re-implementation.
  * In **FlexSeedScheme** the `FlexTonalPalette` method `asList` and constructor `fromList`, now include the values of the error color in produced asList, and as required values in fromList.

**STYLE CHANGES**

* Updated `ElevatedButton` to support `useMaterial3` defaults concerning its switched foreground and background color roles. It now also uses stadium border instead of 20dp, M3 size, padding and elevation defaults, when `useMaterial3` is opted in on. The switched default color values, compared to M2, are to make it compliant with the M3 style by default. You can configure it back to M2 style in M3 mode if you so prefer, by setting background color to `primary` and the foreground color to `surface` or `onPrimary`, for a more M2 styled `ElevatedButton`. Material 3 will also offer two new button styles, called `FilledButton` and `FilledButton.tonal`, which in their default color style are more like `ElevatedButton` in Material 2, but without elevation. These buttons are, however, not yet available in Flutter 3.3. When Flutter stable supports them, they will be added to FlexColorScheme as well.

* Updated `OutlinedButton` to support `useMaterial3` defaults concerning its outline color default. It now also uses stadium border instead of 20dp, M3 size and padding, when `useMaterial3` is opted in on.

* Updated `TextButton` to support `useMaterial3` defaults concerning its usage of the stadium border, instead of 20dp radius, as well M3 size and padding, when `useMaterial3` is opted in on.

* `FlexSubThemesData.fabUseShape` opinionated component theme style default was changed from `true` to `false`, this breaks previous default style. The opinionated style change was done to use a style that by default matches M3 style when `ThemeData.useMaterial3` is `true`. The new default style is also a way to work around issue [#107946](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/107946), where it is shown that you cannot create a theme that replicates the default rounding in M3 of the FAB, by offering it as default. 
  **Style migration**: If you had kept `FlexSubThemesData.fabUseShape` unspecified and relied on default value in a previous version, you must set it to `true` to get the same result as before. Breaking style changes like this, in the opinionated opt-in component sub-themes are unfortunate, but required as FlexColorScheme continues to evolve with Flutter SDK to support Material 3 theming.

* The opt-in opinionated tinted text themes were made less aggressive on the tint amount and also received a bit of opacity on styles that in 2014/2018/2021 `Typography` have opacity. The custom styles use significantly less opacity, since they also get alpha-blended tint color applied. Combining it with the same level of opacity would make them too low contrast.

* The main text theme now uses `surfaceTint` color instead of `primary` when tinted text theme is enabled. By default `surfaceTint` equals `primary`, but if theme `surfaceTint` is set to use a custom color, the for surface tinted textTheme is now also based on it. This makes it match the custom tinted surfaces as well. The primary text theme, that fits on primary color, still always uses `primary` color as its tint color.

* The `FlexAppBarStyle` property was made nullable. It now defaults to null in all constructors. When it is null and `useMaterial3` is false, the app bar will use style `FlexAppBarStyle.primary` in light mode as default, like before and `FlexAppBarStyle.material` in dark mode. However, if `useMaterial3` is true, then it will use `FlexAppBarStyle.surface` in both light and dark mode, to match the un-themed defaults of Material 3 design `AppBar`.

* Changed opinionated dialog sub-theme defaults to match M3 defaults. Elevation now set to 6, it was 10 and actionsPadding defaults to `EdgeInsets.only(left: 24.0, right: 24.0, bottom: 24.0)`, it did not have a custom default before. These are new defaults for the opinionated dialog sub-theme for both the M2 and M3 mode.

* Updated `Chip` sub-theme when opting in on `useMaterial3`. When `true` it now uses M3-styled Chips instead of its own opinionated custom style, also when the opinionated component sub-themes are enabled. To get the same opinionated coloring as before, but on the M3 styled chips when using M3, set component sub-themes data `subThemesData: const FlexSubThemesData(chipSchemeColor: SchemeColor.primary)`.

* Updated `InputDecoration` default sub-theme when opting in on `useMaterial3`. When `true` it now results in a more upcoming M3 styled `TextField` style by default, instead of its own more opinionated custom style, also when the opinionated component sub-themes are enabled. It still uses a lot of its own styles, in M3 mode, because TextField's real M3 design is not yet available in Flutter 3.3. 
  * TextField's FCS opinionated style, combined with M3 real defaults, will need more work on M3 styles after ["Migrate TextField to Material 3"](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/108366) lands in the stable channel. The M3 alignment of FCS `InputDecoration` planned adjustments are:
    - Using the same error container color idea, for the FCS defaults that M3 uses, could be OK for both modes.
    - Option to use FCS component defaults on fill colors and disabled colors, also when opting in on M3. These FCS defaults can provide a nice alternative also when opting in on M3, but we should not force it on M3 unless asked for.

**BREAKING: REMOVED DEPRECATED MEMBERS**

All previously deprecated members have been removed from version 6.0.0. FCS no longer has any self-deprecated members. This removes legacy backwards compatibility with deprecated members from versions 2, 3 and 4, and even one from version 5.1.0. The removed deprecated members are:

* *FlexSubThemesData:*  
  `inputDecorationRadius`, `bottomNavigationBarSchemeColor`,
  `navigationBarIsStyled`, `navigationBarTextSchemeColor`, `navigationBarMutedUnselectedText`,
  `navigationBarIconSchemeColor`, `navigationBarHighlightSchemeColor`.
* *FlexColorScheme:*  
  `primaryVariant`, `secondaryVariant`, `useSubThemes`. Removed static `FlexColorScheme.m3TextTheme`
  deprecated in 5.1.0 and static `FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar` in version
  2 its deprecated parameter `nullContextBackground`.
* *FlexThemeData:*  
  `primaryVariant`, `secondaryVariant`, `useSubThemes`.
* *FlexSchemeColor:*  
  `primaryVariant`, `secondaryVariant`.
* *SchemeColor:*  
  `primaryVariant`, `secondaryVariant`.
* *FlexConstants:*  
  `kDarkenSecondaryVariant`, `kDarkenSecondaryVariantFromSecondary`, `kDarkenPrimaryVariant`.
* *FlexSubThemes.bottomNavigationBar:*
  `baseSchemeColor`.
* *FlexSubThemes.navigationBarTheme:*
  `textSchemeColor`, `unselectedTextSchemeColor`, `mutedUnselectedText`, `iconSchemeColor`,
  `highlightSchemeColor`.

## Version 5.1.0

Updated to support latest Flutter package dependencies in example apps. Supports and requires at least **Flutter 3.0.0** and **Dart 2.17.0**.

**NEW FEATURES**

* Added support for in Flutter 3.0.0 new `ColorScheme.surfaceTint` color. It is set to `ColorScheme.primary` color by default, as Flutter and Material 3 does. If a custom `surfaceTint` color is provided, it is also used as the blend color, instead of `primary` color, for FlexColorScheme's surface blend feature.

* Added API for using Flutter 3.0.0 theme extensions directly via FlexColorScheme API. It was added as a convenience feature in order to avoid having to add theme extensions with a `copyWith` on FlexColorScheme produced ThemeData. With the `FlexColorScheme.extensions` and `FlexThemeData.extensions` properties you can add custom theme extensions directly.

**STYLE CHANGES**

* Floating Action Button background color, will when opting in on `ThemeData.useMaterial3`, use color `theme.colorScheme.primaryContainer`, otherwise `theme.colorScheme.secondary` is used.

* The `TextField` and its `InputDecorator` border radius default value was changed from 20 dp to 16 dp when using opinionated component themes. If opting in on Material 3, the default value for M3 design is used, which is only 4 dp.  See specification https://m3.material.io/components/text-fields/specs. Flutter 3.0.x does not yet implement the new M3 TextField style, but via this change when opting in on M3, FlexColorScheme offers an early approximation of it.

* Default colors of `NavigationBar` when opting in on `useMaterial3` and not using opinionated component themes will now match M3 default colors. The background color will follow M3 style also by default when component themes are enabled and `useMaterial3` is true. This style is difficult to replicate with a single color otherwise. The difference is subtle for FCS surface tinted background colors. You can still set it to `background` color to replicate past FCS default color when sub-themes were enabled. For other properties, if opinionated component themes are not used, FCS will use default M3 theme styles on `NavigationBar` when `useMaterial3` is true. If opting in on opinionated component themes, FCS uses its own custom and opinionated default style. This can be modified to be the same as the default M3 style too. The change also includes a default font size change for FCS opinionated styled navigation bar, from 11dp to 12dp. This change was done to harmonize it with its M3 style.

* Default colors of `NavigationRail` when opting in on `useMaterial3` and not using opinionated component themes will now match M3 default colors. If opinionated component themes are not used, FCS will use default M3 theme styles on `NavigationRail` when `useMaterial3` is true. If opting in on opinionated component themes, FCS uses its own custom and opinionated default style. That can be modified to be the same as the default M3 style too. The change also includes a default font size change for FCS opinionated styled rail, from 14dp to 12dp.  This change was done to harmonize it with its M3 style.

* Default color of toggles (`Switch`, `Checkbox` and `Radio`) are now using `primary` color as their default theme color, when opting in on opinionated component themes or setting `ThemeData.useMaterial3` to true. The `Switch`, `Checkbox` and `Radio` themes then use a style that match the M3 color design intent. In it, switches and toggles are mostly primary color based. In M3 color design, the secondary color is a poor choice for switches and toggles, and it is therefore not used as their default color. It does not look nice with M3-based ColorSchemes, created e.g. using M3 color seeding. If you use a custom M3 color design, where secondary color is still prominent, you can, of course, still use it.

## Version 5.0.0

FlexColorScheme [Version 5](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/5.0.0) is a large upgrade from version 4, with deprecation of previous `variant` based color names in favor of `container` ones that were added to updated Material 3 based `ColorScheme` in Flutter 2.10.0. The same additions and changes are now also introduced in FlexColorScheme. Despite being a big release, with many new features, actual breaking changes are very few and mostly concerns in version 4 already deprecated members, and requiring minimum Flutter 2.10.0 to work.

Version 5 has many new advanced coloring features and fully supports Material 3 color schemes, including seeded key color generated color schemes. With more configuration options to generate the `ColorScheme` from key colors, compared to what is currently available in Flutter SDK. Version 5 also comes with many more convenient component sub-theming options compared to previous versions.

The open source companion app, the [**Themes Playground**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5) has been completely revised. It now has two view modes, the previous large masonry grid and also a convenient topic-based page view. In the new version, you can also see the generated theme setup code as you change your theming settings.

This is a **breaking** release, with many new Material 3 ColorScheme features. See [change log](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/5.0.0/changelog) for detailed change information. 

The example apps have all been updated. New live web builds for v5 are available here:

* [1. Basic Theme v5](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/basictheme-v5)
* [2. Custom Theme v5](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/customtheme-v5)
* [3. Four Themes v5](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/fourthemes-v5)
* [4. All Themes v5](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/allthemes-v5)
* [5. Themes Playground v5](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5).

Version 5 of the [**Themes Playground**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5) application demonstrates all the new features, including using Material 3 key color, seeded color schemes. The playground has its own [usage guide](/playground) chapter. The updated **Copy Playground Theme** template can be used to quickly test themes using copy-pasted setup code from the Playground.

The default example, the **Hot Reload Playground** has also been updated. Its comments contain extensive documentation that serves as a getting started guide as well.

For a guided tour of what is new, check out this [Tweet and its thread](https://twitter.com/RydMike/status/1503224831122321409?s=20&t=JRM8j593geAYBfXyXLRjTQ),
where Flutter Dash explains all the new features in a dashing slide series.

<Tweet id="1503224831122321409" cards />

The slides in the tweet thread is using the Themes Playground app from the 5.0.0-dev.1 release. The final released version 5 of the app is a lot fancier, but all the FlexColorScheme V5 and also later V6 features and principles are the same as in the above thread. It is still a useful quick guide.

### New V5 Themes

There are, of course, new built-in color schemes in version 5. Four new themes, are the de-facto standard for major new releases. The new color schemes are:

* **Flutter Dash**, a blue Flutter Dash wallpaper based Material 3 theme.
* **M3 baseline**, Material guide 3 baseline based theme.
* **Verdun green** and mineral green with hemlock, based Material 3 theme.
* **Dell genoa green**, a Material 3 theme with dell, axolotl and genoa greens.

## Version 4.0.0

There are two major new features. The first one is that FlexColorScheme now comes with **opinionated widget sub themes** that you can opt in on. By default, these Flutter UI component widget sub-themes follow the [Material 3 guide](https://m3.material.io/). This is done as far as reasonably possible while still using standard Material 2 theming features available in Flutter 2.8. There is a Material 3 TextTheme as well. By default, this text theme is also slightly color tinted using the color scheme's primary color. You can turn these styles on and off, based on your own preferences when you opt in on the sub themes.

The second main new feature is that FlexColorScheme now offers **9 different surface color blend modes**, with **40 different blend levels** each. Version 3 only had one "blend style" with 5 levels, including the no blend option. The version 3 blend style API is still available and works, but is deprecated since version 4.2.0. Despite the major version bump from 3 to 4, all APIs from version 3 are fully compatible with version 4. The version was mostly bumped because it contains so many new features that it made sense.

There are, of course, new built-in color schemes. Four of them seem to be the standard for major new releases. The new color schemes are:

* **Blue whale**, with jungle green and outrageous tango orange.
* **San Juan**, and pink salmon theme.
* **Rosewood**, with horses neck and driftwood theme.
* **Blumine**, easter blue and saffron mango theme.

The total number of offered built-in color schemes is now **36 matched light and dark pairs**. By using the swap primary and secondary colors, you can double the number of variations with just a boolean toggle. Not all the color schemes are so attractive when you swap the colors, but some were designed to support it and look well with the colors reversed too. You can, for example, use this to present the dark mode with primary and secondary colors swapped compared to the light mode.
