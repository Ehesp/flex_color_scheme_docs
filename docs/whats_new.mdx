# What Is New?

This chapter features recent news and updates in **FlexColorScheme**. For more complete and older updates, please refer to the package [changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/changelog).

## Documentation

This documentation site and its content is still fairly new and was launched together with the package 5.0.0 release. It will be improved over time, concerning spelling, grammar, style and content. Improvement suggestions and corrections to the documentation are welcome contributions.

## Version 6.0.0

Updated to support Flutter 3.3.0, Dart 2.18 and latest Flutter package dependencies in example apps. Requires at least Flutter 3.3.0 and Dart 2.18.0.

Docs are not yet updated to fully cover the new release, coming soon. Meanwhile take a look at [changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/changelog).

## Version 5.1.0

Updated to support Flutter 3.0.0, Dart 2.17 and latest Flutter package dependencies in example apps. Requires at least Flutter 3.0.0 and Dart 2.17.0.

### New Features in v5.1.0

* Added support for in Flutter 3.0.0 new `ColorScheme.surfaceTint` color. It is set to `ColorScheme.primary` color by default, as Flutter and Material 3 does. If a custom `surfaceTint` color is provided, it is also used as the blend color, instead of `primary` color, for FlexColorScheme's surface blend feature.

* Added API for using Flutter 3.0.0 theme extensions directly via FlexColorScheme API. It was added as a convenience feature in order to avoid having to add theme extensions with a `copyWith` on FlexColorScheme produced ThemeData. With the `FlexColorScheme.extensions` and `FlexThemeData.extensions` properties you can add custom theme extensions directly.

### Changes in v5.1.0

* Floating Action Button background color, will when opting in on `ThemeData.useMaterial3`, use color `theme.colorScheme.primaryContainer`, otherwise `theme.colorScheme.secondary` is used.

* The `TextField` and its `InputDecorator` border radius default value was changed from 20 dp to 16 dp when using opinionated component themes. If opting in on Material 3, the default value for M3 design is used, which is only 4 dp.  See specification https://m3.material.io/components/text-fields/specs. Flutter 3.0.x does not yet implement the new M3 TextField style, but via this change when opting in on M3, FlexColorScheme offers an early approximation of it.

* Default colors of `NavigationBar` when opting in on `useMaterial3` and not using opinionated component themes will now match M3 default colors. The background color will follow M3 style also by default when component themes are enabled and `useMaterial3` is true. This style is difficult to replicate with a single color otherwise. The difference is subtle for FCS surface tinted background colors. You can still set it to `background` color to replicate past FCS default color when sub-themes were enabled. For other properties, if opinionated component themes are not used, FCS will use default M3 theme styles on `NavigationBar` when `useMaterial3` is true. If opting in on opinionated component themes, FCS uses its own custom opinionated default style. Which can be modified to be the same as default M3 style too, just as before. The change also includes a default font size change for FCS opinionated styled navigation bar, from 11dp to 12dp. This change was done to harmonize it with its M3 style.

* Default colors of `NavigationRail` when opting in on `useMaterial3` and not using opinionated component themes will now match M3 default colors. If opinionated component themes are not used, FCS will use default M3 theme styles on `NavigationRail` when `useMaterial3` is true. If opting in on opinionated component themes, FCS uses its own custom opinionated default style. Which can be modified to be the same as default M3 style too, just as before. The change also includes a default font size change for FCS opinionated styled rail, from 14dp to 12dp.  This change was done to harmonize it with its M3 style.

* Default color of toggles (Switch, CheckBox and Radio) are now using `primary` color as default themed color when opting in on opinionated component themes or setting `ThemeData.useMaterial3` to true. The Switch, CheckBox and Radio themes then use a style that match the M3 color design intent. In it, switches and toggles are mostly primary color based. In M3 color design, the secondary color is a poor choice for switches and toggles, and it is therefore not used as their default color. It does not look nice with M3 based ColorSchemes, created e.g. using M3 color seeding. If you use a custom M3 color design, where secondary color is still prominent, you can of course still use it.

## Version 5.0.0

FlexColorScheme [Version 5](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/5.0.0) is a large upgrade from version 4, with deprecation of previous `variant` based color names in favor of `container` ones that were added to updated Material 3 based `ColorScheme` in Flutter 2.10.0. The same additions and changes are now also introduced in FlexColorScheme. Despite being a big release, with many new features, actual breaking changes are very few and mostly concern in version 4 already deprecated members, and of course requiring minimum Flutter 2.10.0 to work.

Version 5 has many new advanced coloring features and fully supports Material 3 based color schemes, including seed key color generated color schemes. With more configuration options to generate the `ColorScheme` from key colors, compared to what is currently available in Flutter SDK. Version 5 also comes with many more convenient component sub-theming options compared to previous versions.

The open source companion app, the [**Themes Playground**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5) has been completely revised. It now has two view modes, the previous large masonry grid and also a convenient topic based page view. In the new version you can also see the generated theme setup
code as you change your theming settings.

This is a **breaking** release, with many new Material 3 ColorScheme features.
See [change log](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/5.0.0/changelog) for detailed change information. Generated [API docs](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/flex_color_scheme-library.html) are available and up to date with version 5.

The example apps have all also been updated. New live web builds of them are available here:

* [1. Basic Theme](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/basictheme-v5)
* [2. Custom Theme](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/customtheme-v5)
* [3. Four Themes](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/fourthemes-v5)
* [4. All Themes](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/allthemes-v5)
* [5. Themes Playground](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5).

Version 5 of the [**Themes Playground**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5) application demonstrates all the new features, including using Material 3 key color based seeded color schemes. The playground has its own [usage guide](/playground) chapter. The updated **Copy Playground Theme** template, can be used to quickly test themes using copy-pasted setup code from the Themes Playground.

The default example, the **Hot Reload Playground** has also been updated. Its comments contain extensive documentation that serve as a getting started guide as well.

where Flutter Dash explains all the new features in a dashing slide series.

The slide series is using the Themes Playground app from the 5.0.0-dev.1 release. The current version of the app is a lot fancier, but all the FlexColorScheme V5 features and principles are the same as in the above tweet.

### New v5.0.0 Themes

There are of course new built-in color schemes in version 5. Four of them is by now the de-facto standard for major new releases. The new color schemes are:

* **Flutter Dash** - A blue Flutter Dash wallpaper based Material 3 theme.
* **M3 baseline** - Material guide 3 baseline based theme.
* **Verdun green** - Verdun and mineral green with hemlock based Material 3 theme.
* **Dell genoa green** - A Material 3 theme with dell, axolotl and genoa greens.

## New in Version 4

There are two major new features. The first one is that FlexColorScheme now comes with **opinionated widget sub themes** that you can opt-in on. By default, these Flutter UI component widget sub-themes follow the [Material 3 guide](https://m3.material.io/). This is done as far as reasonably possible while still using standard Material 2 theming features available in Flutter 2.8. There is a Material 3 style TextTheme as well, and by default this text theme is also slightly color tinted using the color scheme's primary color. You can turn these styles on and off, based on your your own preferences when you opt in on the sub themes.

The second main new feature is that FlexColorScheme now offers **9 different surface color blend modes**, with **40 different blend levels** each. Version 3 only had one "blend style" with 5 levels, including the no blend option. The version 3 blend style API is still available and works, but is deprecated since version 4.2.0. Despite the major version bump from 3 to 4, all APIs from version 3 are fully compatible with version 4. The version was mostly bumped because it contains so many new features that it made sense.

There are of course new built-in color schemes. Four of them seems to be the standard for major new releases. The new color schemes are:

* **Blue whale** - Blue whale, jungle green and outrageous tango orange
* **San Juan** - San Juan blue and pink salmon theme
* **Rosewood** - Rosewood red, with horses neck and driftwood theme
* **Blumine** - Blumine, easter blue and saffron mango theme

Total number of offered built-in color schemes is now **36 matched light and dark pairs**. By using the swap primary and secondary colors, you can double the amount of variations with just a boolean toggle. Not all the color schemes are so attractive when you swap the colors, but some were designed to support it and look well with the colors reversed too. You can for example use this to present the dark mode with primary and secondary colors swapped compared to the light mode.
