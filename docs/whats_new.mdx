# What is new?

The what's new chapter covers the last two major releases. Older what's new chapters are purged
as new ones are added.

## New in Version 5

FlexColorScheme [Version 5](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/5.0.0-dev.2)
is a large upgrade from version 4, with deprecation of previous `variant` based color names in
favor of `container` ones that were added to updated Material 3 based `ColorScheme` in Flutter 2.10.0.
The same additions and changes are now also introduced in FlexColorScheme. Despite being a big release,
with many new features, actual breaking changes are very few and mostly concern in version 4 already
deprecated members, and of course requiring minimum Flutter 2.10.0 to work.

Version 5 has many new advanced coloring features and fully supports Material 3 based color schemes,
including seed key color generated color schemes. With more configuration options to generate the
`ColorScheme`from key colors, compared to what is currently available in Flutter SDK directly.

Version 5 also comes with many more convenient component sub-theming options compared to previous
versions.

The companion app, the [**Themes Playground**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5)
has been completely revised. It now has two view modes, the previous large masonry grid and also a
convenient topic based page view. In the new version you can also see the generated theme setup
code as you change your theming settings. The app is still open source, more will be written
about it in the docs and maybe in an article as well later.

This is a **minor breaking** release, with many major new Material 3 ColorScheme features.
See [change log](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/5.0.0-dev.2/changelog) for detailed change information.
Generated [API docs](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/5.0.0-dev.2/flex_color_scheme/flex_color_scheme-library.html)
are available and up to date with version 5.

The example apps have all also been updated. The live web builds of them are available here:
* [1) Basic Theme](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/basictheme-v5)
* [2) Custom Theme](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/customtheme-v5)
* [3) Four Themes](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/fourthemes-v5)
* [4) All Themes](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/allthemes-v5)
* [5) Themes Playground](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5)

  Version 5 of the [**Themes Playground**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5)
  application demonstrates all the new features,
  including using Material 3 key color based seeded ColorSchemes.

* The default example, the **Hot Reload Playground** has also been updated.
  Its comments contain extensive documentation that can serve as a
  getting started guide as well.

* The **Copy Playground Theme** template, can be used to test themes
  using copy-pasted setup code from the Themes Playground app.

### New in Version 4

For a detailed list of what is new in version 4, please refer to the
[change log](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/changelog).

There are two major new features. The first one is that FlexColorScheme
now comes with **opinionated widget sub themes** that you can opt in on.
By default, these Flutter UI widget sub themes follow the
[Material 3 guide](https://m3.material.io/). This is done
as far as reasonably possible while still using standard Material 2 theming features
available in Flutter 2.8. There is a Material 3 style TextTheme as well, and by
default this text theme is also slightly color tinted using the color
scheme's primary color. You can turn these styles on and off, based on your
your own preferences when you opt in on the sub themes.

The second main new feature is that FlexColorScheme now offers **9 different surface
color blend modes**, with **40 different blend levels** each. Version 3 only had one
"blend style" with 5 levels, including the no blend option.
The version 3 blend style API is still available and works, but is deprecated
since version 4.2.0. Despite the major version bump from 3 to 4, all APIs from
version 3 are fully compatible with version 4. The version was mostly bumped
because it contains so many new features that it made sense.

### Version 4 New Themes

There are of course new built-in color schemes. Four of them seems to
be the standard for major new releases. The new color schemes are:

* **Blue whale** - Blue whale, jungle green and outrageous tango orange
* **San Juan** - San Juan blue and pink salmon theme
* **Rosewood** - Rosewood red, with horses neck and driftwood theme
* **Blumine** - Blumine, easter blue and saffron mango theme

Total number of offered built-in color schemes is now **36 matched light
and dark pairs**. By using the swap primary and secondary colors, you can double
the amount of variations with just a boolean toggle. Not all the color
schemes are so attractive when you swap the colors, but some were designed to
support it and look well with the colors reversed too. You can for example use
this to present the dark mode with primary and secondary colors swapped
compared to the light mode.
