# Flutter Theming Introduction

**TODO: Review and update chapter to version 5, with TOTALLY revised structure and content.**

When you make themed Flutter applications you should base the colors of your
application on a light theme mode suitable `ColorScheme`, and a dark theme mode
`ColorScheme`. Then create your light and dark `ThemeData` using these color
schemes, by assigning the `ColorScheme` for each mode to the `colorScheme`
property in `ThemeData`. In your `MaterialApp` you then assign the `ThemeData`
for your light, and dark theme to the `theme` and `darkTheme` properties
in the `MaterialApp`.

This gives you an application that uses the defined color schemes on all the
Flutter SDK built-in Material UI widgets. Well, on most of them anyway.
Flutter's `ThemeData.from` a `ColorScheme` has a few gaps. The used color scheme
is not consistently applied on all built-in Flutter SDK Material UI Widgets.
To get it really right, you also have to assign the colors from your
`ColorScheme` to a number of color properties that still
exist as direct properties in `ThemeData`.

## Flutter ThemeData

At its core, `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` creates a `ThemeData` object. It helps
you make a color scheme based, consistent and a more refined
Flutter `ThemeData` object.

The Flutter `ThemeData` object is a very large theme property data,
and theme behavior controlling class. It can change the look and feel of Flutter
applications completely. It is not really that difficult to use, but it has many
quirks and oddities, especially when it comes to used colors. This is mostly
due to past legacy and things that were not considered early on. Some parts were
done differently first, later things changed, but those earlier ways are
still supported to not break past behavior, together with some newer ways to
define and setup colors.

This is all further complicated by the fact that
under the hood many Flutter SDK UI widgets still use the original direct color
properties in `ThemeData`. These properties are now mostly assigned color
values via `ThemeData.colorScheme`. Exactly how depends on which
`ThemeData` factory constructor you use.

Many older widgets still do not use the `ThemeData.colorScheme` properties for
their default color values directly, they still use color property values in
`ThemeData`, that got assigned values from `ThemeData.colorScheme`, that varies
depending on used `ThemeData` factory! Still with me?
Very basic and old widgets, like for example `Material` and `Card` fall into
this category.
While some newer widgets actually do use colors from `ThemeData.colorScheme`
directly. Additionally, the colors in the
`ColorScheme` held by the `colorScheme` property in `ThemeData` can actually not
represent all the colors that exist in `ThemeData`'s color properties. Thus, some
of those color properties never get any `ColorScheme` based values assigned to
them. They are left to default values assigned by the `ThemeData` factory,
unless you explicitly assign them some color that fits with your color scheme.
If this is not done, it can then look odd when some widgets use the factory
default colors, while the rest of your app's widgets correctly use the
`ColorScheme` based colors. Luckily there are not so many widgets left that this
still applies to, but there are a few, for example `CircleAvatar`.

It can all be very confusing and frustrating to fight with ThemeData and its
colors, and if not done properly, it may result in themes with color schemes
that are not entirely consistent or logical across all standard SDK
widgets in your application.

One of the fundamental things FlexColorScheme does, is that it fixes these minor
inconsistencies and gaps that exist with Flutter's `ThemeData.from` factory
and handles the complexity of using the `ThemeData` factory directly. It
releases you from the burden of knowing what colors in it affects which widgets
how.

FlexColorScheme makes a few opinionated, but subtle theme modifications compared
to the `ThemeData.from` themes created from a `ColorScheme`. By default,
FlexColorScheme theming refrains from touching theme properties not related
to making the colors more consistent. Some minor adjustments were however
needed. This is covered in detail in the external
[inside FlexColorScheme document (external link)](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/INSIDE.md).

There is a Flutter development plan to deprecate most, if not all, of the direct
color properties in the `ThemeData` class. Flutter SDK Widgets should after that
only use `ColorScheme` based colors that are in the ThemeData `colorScheme`
property, as the default colors for their designs. This design
[document](https://flutter.dev/go/material-theme-system-updates)
describes the plan and reasoning. There is also a color property deprecation
check list [issue 91772](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91772) to
mirror this plan.

For FlexColorScheme the progress of these actions are monitored
closely. Needed changes and updates in FlexColorScheme will be implemented when
related changes in ThemeData reach the Flutter stable channel. FlexColorScheme
already of course correctly defines a `ColorScheme` for `ThemeData`. The
typical maintenance need is removing deprecated `ThemeData` properties and check
if some new sub-theme color property needs to be modified to replicate past
FlexColorScheme theming behavior, when its corresponding color property is
removed from `ThemeData`.

## Color Blended Surfaces

The Material 2 Guide briefly mentions
[color branded and blended surfaces](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#properties).
In the new version of Material Design called [Material You and now also known as
Material 3](https://m3.material.io/), color branded or blended and also
just colored surfaces, are used extensively. It is done in more flexible ways
than what can be done with theming alone in current version of Flutter. We look
forward to seeing these features soon in Flutter as well.

With **FlexColorScheme** you can already with current version of Flutter SDK
easily create fancy looking primary color branded
and alpha blended themes. These themes work natively with the current Material
2 design based themes and all UI widgets in the current version of Flutter.

The themes are created by using different blend modes and blend level strengths,
for blending in primary color into surface and background colors. This can bring
different and new nuances to your application. Below an example of the
same theme, but using different blend modes and levels. The effect can be kept
very subtle or made very bold and impactful.

The first light and dark image pair show the theme using blend level 0.
At level 0 there are no alpha blends of primary color in any surfaces, so all
modes look the same. The next six images use the same blend level strength 18,
but show six different blend modes. Next, one of the modes is repeated,
but at blend level 33. Last the theme that was used to generate all these
different nuances of the same color scheme based theme, is shown.

_FlexColorScheme using same theme, but with
different blend modes and levels (click image to open hires version)_

There are **9 different blend modes at 40 different levels each**, that you can
choose from, to tune a theme to your liking. You don't have to use the
same blend mode or level for your light and dark theme mode, the included
examples only do so to keep the interactive examples simpler. Often a
different blend mode and level for your light and dark themes, may produce
a more balanced or more impactful result, depending on your design goal.

The above images were made with the **Themes Playground** (example 5) app
running as a phone app, instead of using the
[web demo](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut5).
The application is open source, and is included as the last example in the
pub.dev bundled examples and on
[GitHub here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example5).
The **Themes Playground** is an interesting and useful tool when you want to
find fitting themes, blend modes and levels to use as your application's
FlexColorScheme based theme. It even allows you to copy/paste the code needed
to make the Flutter theme you are looking at.
