# 3) Four Themes

The third tutorial example shows how we can use three built-in color schemes, add a custom
scheme, using the same colors as in example 2. We then use these four color schemes
as selectable `FlexColorScheme` based theme options. The example also uses surface
colors with primary color blends.

Only code highlights might be shown below, the complete code for the example is
[here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example3).

## ThemeServicePrefs

The `main` start function of the app is very similar to example 2, but in this
case we use another `ThemeService` implementation, the `ThemeServicePrefs`
version, that will locally persist the theme selection options we make.

The `ThemeServicePrefs` persistence is based on the popular package
[SharedPreferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences).

We also again use the same ThemeController, which glues our theme settings to
Flutter Widgets. The controller uses an abstract ThemeService interface to get
and save the settings. There are 3 concrete implementations available that we
can use in these examples.

  0. ThemeService      - Abstract interface base class.
  1. ThemeServiceMem   - Only keeps settings in memory.
  2. ThemeServicePrefs - Persist settings locally using SharedPreferences.
  3. ThemeServiceHive  - Persist settings locally using Hive.

  In this example chose the `ThemeServicePrefs` option. The examples are all
  built using same "example" app. If we use SharedPreferences in more than one
  of them, they would all use the same storage container and share the settings
  when you build them locally. By using Hive for most examples, we can change
  the storage container name for each example. In these demos the
  SharedPreferences service is only used in this example. You can swap
  in the Hive based one here as well, or SharedPreferences on the other ones,
  if you want to try it.

  These tuturials are not about how to setup the used Flutter skeleton style
  controller, or how to make the abstract service with three different
  implementations. Still they do demonstrate with these examples
  how one can easily swap the used persistence implementation. You can take
  a peek at the source code of examples 2 to 5, to learn more about how it
  is done here.

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Here we use the Shared Preferences theme servcie.
  final ThemeService themeService = ThemeServicePrefs();
  // Initialize the theme service.
  await themeService.init();
  // Create a ThemeController that uses the ThemeService.
  final ThemeController themeController = ThemeController(themeService);
  // Load preferred theme settings, while the app is loading, before MaterialApp
  // is created, this prevents a theme change when the app is first displayed.
  await themeController.loadAll();
  // Run the app and pass in the ThemeController. The app listens to the
  // ThemeController for changes.
  runApp(DemoApp(themeController: themeController));
}
```

In this example we use the theme controller to change the `themeMode` and to
toggle opting in and out of FlexColorScheme's opinionated component sub-themes.
We also use it to chnage a number of other settings the theme
controller provides.

## Custom Colors

We use the same custom colors as in example 2.

```dart
const FlexSchemeData _myFlexScheme = FlexSchemeData(
  name: 'Midnight blue',
  description: 'Midnight blue theme, custom definition of all colors',
  light: FlexSchemeColor(
    primary: Color(0xFF00296B),
    primaryContainer: Color(0xFFA0C2ED),
    secondary: Color(0xFFD26900),
    secondaryContainer: Color(0xFFFFD270),
    tertiary: Color(0xFF5C5C95),
    tertiaryContainer: Color(0xFFC8DBF8),
  ),
  dark: FlexSchemeColor(
    primary: Color(0xFFB1CFF5),
    primaryContainer: Color(0xFF3873BA),
    secondary: Color(0xFFFFD270),
    secondaryContainer: Color(0xFFD26900),
    tertiary: Color(0xFFC9CBFC),
    tertiaryContainer: Color(0xFF535393),
  ),
);
```

## Theme Setup

The `AnimatedBuilder` and `MaterialApp` setup is as it was in the previous
example. New in this example is that we set `surfaceMode` to
`FlexSurfaceMode.highSurfaceLowScaffold`
and `blendLevel` to 10. This gives us the same primary color alpha blend level,
on the theme's `ColorScheme` background and surface colors, while scaffold
background color uses a much lower blend.

In dark mode we decided to use the inverted `surfaceMode` blend to this, the
`highScaffoldLowSurfaces`, where surface and background colors have a lower
primary color alpha blend, in relation the Scaffold background color. We also
set the used blend level a bit higher, to 12 in dark mode.

```dart
class DemoApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const DemoApp({Key? key, required this.themeController}) : super(key: key);
  final ThemeController themeController;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AnimatedBuilder(
      animation: themeController,
      builder: (BuildContext context, Widget? child) {
        return MaterialApp(
          debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
          scrollBehavior: const AppScrollBehavior(),
          title: 'Four Themes',
          theme: FlexThemeData.light(
            colors: themeController.usedScheme == FlexScheme.custom
                ? _myFlexScheme.light
                : FlexColor.schemes[themeController.usedScheme]!.light,
            surfaceMode: FlexSurfaceMode.highSurfaceLowScaffold,
            blendLevel: 10,
            appBarElevation: 0.5,
            subThemesData:
                themeController.useSubThemes ? const FlexSubThemesData() : null,
            keyColors: FlexKeyColors(
              useKeyColors: themeController.useKeyColors,
              useSecondary: themeController.useSecondary,
              useTertiary: themeController.useTertiary,
            ),
            visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
            fontFamily: GoogleFonts.notoSans().fontFamily,
          ),
          // We make an equivalent definition for the dark theme, but using
          // FlexThemeData.dark() and the dark FlexSchemeColors instead.
          darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
            colors: themeController.usedScheme == FlexScheme.custom
                ? _myFlexScheme.dark
                : FlexColor.schemes[themeController.usedScheme]!.dark,
            surfaceMode: FlexSurfaceMode.highScaffoldLowSurfaces,
            blendLevel: 12,
            appBarElevation: 1,
            subThemesData:
                themeController.useSubThemes ? const FlexSubThemesData() : null,
            keyColors: FlexKeyColors(
              useKeyColors: themeController.useKeyColors,
              useSecondary: themeController.useSecondary,
              useTertiary: themeController.useTertiary,
            ),
            visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
            fontFamily: GoogleFonts.notoSans().fontFamily,
          ),
          // Use the dark or light theme, based on controller setting.
          themeMode: themeController.themeMode,
          // This simple example app has only one page.
          home: HomePage(
            flexSchemeData: themeController.usedScheme == FlexScheme.custom
                ? _myFlexScheme
                : FlexColor.schemes[themeController.usedScheme]!,
            // Pass in the theme controller to the home page.
            controller: themeController,
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Below we go through the above theme setup in more detail.

## Selecting theme

We select the used active theme for the app by using the theme controller's
`usedScheme` property, that contains the value of currently selected
`FlexScheme` enum. If it is the `custom` value, we use our custom scheme
`_myFlexScheme` colors. If it is any other value, we get the corresponding
colors from the `FlexColor.schemes` map, using the enum value as key.

On the `HomePage` we have a Flutter SDK `ToggleButtons` based UI widget, that
allows us the select one 4 different `FlexScheme` enum values, it changes the
`ThemeController` accordingly. The used enum values we can use are
`hippieBlue`, `mallardGreen`, `outerSpace` and the `custom` option.

```dart
ListTile(
  contentPadding: EdgeInsets.zero,
  title: const Text('Select theme'),
  trailing: ThemeSelectButtons(
    scheme: controller.usedScheme,
    onChanged: controller.setUsedScheme,
  ),
),
```

The `ThemeSelectButtons` is just a simple stateless widget using Flutter
`ToggleButtons` to make an enum value based toggle selector, you can find
it [here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/example/lib/example3/widgets/theme_select_buttons.dart).

## Component Themes
As in example 2 the `themeController` is also used to decide if we opt in or out on using
the new sub theming via `useSubThemes`. A simple on/off switch on the `HomePage`
allows us to toggle its state between true and false, thus turning on or off
the usage of FlexColorScheme's sub theming feature.

When the opt-in is true we pass in a default
`FlexSubThemesData()` constructor, otherwise `null` to not use the
sub themes at all. Later we will explore more options that we can configure with
`FlexSubThemesData`

```dart
  // Opt in/out on using FlexColorScheme sub-themes.
  subThemesData: themeController.useSubThemes
      ? const FlexSubThemesData()
      : null,
```

## VisualDensity

In this example we also use `FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity` as
`visualDensity` for our `ThemeData` is a platform adaptive visual density
setting for our theme. It is similar to the Flutter SDK
`VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity`.

```dart
  // Use FlexColorScheme static helper comfortablePlatformDensity.
  visualDensity: FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity,
```

With the difference that it returns comfortable density on desktops,
instead of compact, like the `VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity` does.
This setting is a good compromise for desktop, especially if they have touch
screens, since it keeps buttons and touch targets larger, but
not as large as on small hand held devices.

## Seeded ColorScheme

Flutter 2.10 includes the option to use Material 3 based key color seed generated
`ColorScheme`'s. FlexColorScheme version 5.0 and later, can do the same and
much more. Flutter's seeded `ColorScheme`s are based on `ColorScheme.fromSeed`
using a single **"main"** or primary input color as the seed color. With
FlexColorScheme you can optionally use different key colors for the primary,
secondary and tertiary generated `ColorScheme`'s tonal palettes.

To learn more about the **Tonal Palette** concept, please see the Material 3 color
guide [here](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/the-color-system/key-colors-tones).

Passing in a default `FlexKeyColors()` to `keyColors` activates
Material 3 key color seed based schemes. The primary color in your active theme
is always used as the main "primary" key for the generated `ColorScheme` when it
is activated. This is the same as using the Flutter SDK `ColorScheme.fromSeed()`
and giving it the primary color.

```dart
// Generate ColorScheme from active theme's primary color.
keyColors: FlexKeyColors(),
```

Flutter SDK only makes seed `ColorScheme`s where the entire scheme is generated
from only one input color. In FlexColorScheme, you can also use the secondary
and tertiary colors, as input keys to seed their Tonal Palette colors.

```dart
// Generate the ColorScheme from active theme's primary,
// secondary and tertiary  colors.
keyColors: FlexKeyColors(
  useSecondary: true,
  useTertiary: true,
),
```

In the example app above we used this setup:

```dart
keyColors: FlexKeyColors(
  useKeyColors: themeController.useKeyColors,
  useSecondary: themeController.useSecondary,
  useTertiary: themeController.useTertiary,
),
```

Where the `themeController.useSecondary` and `themeController.useTertiary` are
`bool` values controlled by our `ThemeController`. The first value
`themeController.useKeyColors` is also a boolean value that we use on the
convenience property `useKeyColors` in the `FlexKeyColors`.
If it is set to false the entire `FlexKeyColors` setup is ignored.
Alternatively, we could also pass in null to `keyColors` when it is false and
then when it is true, the `FlexKeyColors` with its `useSecondary` and
`useTertiary` values.
However, this looks a bit cleaner and is more convenient if you want to toggle the
usage. The `FlexKeyColors.useKeyColors` property is intended and included as a
convenience property for making `FlexKeyColors` easy to toggle via user a
interfaces.

All three `themeController`values above are also again used as choices in a
`ToggleButtons` UI control, where we can select multiple
options, but always has to select the first choice before the other
two become enabled. The `ToggleButtons` UI control is on on the `HomeScreen`
and built as a simple stateless widget called `ThemeSelectButtons`. In this case
the `ToggleButtons` sets the above three boolean controller values. The
`ThemeSelectButtons` contains some minor logic for the inclusion/exclusion of
valid choices. You can find the code for it
[here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/example/lib/shared/widgets/app/use_key_colors_buttons.dart).

The Tonal Palettes are discussed further in [theming guide](/flutter_theming).

## The result

When we build this application, we get an application where we can switch between
four different themes.

Below are the four resulting themes with their light and dark modes, that we
can select and use in this example.

 </table>

theme with common Material UI widgets. You can try this example as a Flutter
[web app here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/fourthemes-v5).

 ## Using Seeded ColorScheme

When key colors are used to generate Material 3 Tonal
Palettes, the same key color(s) should in Material 3 color system design be used
to generate the Tonal Palettes for both the light and dark mode theme.

The `ColorScheme` uses different Tones (shades) from the identical key color
sourced Tonal Palettes to select appropriate tones for the light and dark mode
from these palettes. In the [theming guide](/flutter_theming) we explore these
basic concepts more.

Below we compare the look of the Mallard green theme, using its theme as defined,
versus using its colors as key colors to generate the ColorScheme from those
colors. The result is usually very balanced and pleasing. However, if we look
at the result when using only the primary color as key color, it is not at all the
same ColorScheme as the original one. The result is the same result as creating
the color scheme with `ColorScheme.fromSeed` and giving it the Mallard schemes
primary light theme mode color as input.

As we one by one turn on using also primary and tertiary colors as keys, we see
that the result gets a bit closer to the original design intent. Still the
colors are quite a bit off. In this example when secondary and tertiary are used
as key colors, the Tonal Palette generation is using the chroma from these colors,
but limited to same max values as the `ColorScheme.fromSeed` algorithm uses for
its single seed color.
The color math in the Material 3 Tonal Palette generation is very sophisticated,
but in Flutter SDK very little of it is exposed. FlexColorScheme opens up
more of its capabilities via easy to use APIs. This API also let's you change these
key color chroma limits and even which tone is what for color in the resulting
ColorScheme. This can make generated schemes more vivid or muted, the number of
ways you can tune the Tonal Palette generation is almost limitless.
We will look at this in the last tutorial example.

 This example keeps the primary color surface blend level at the same value for the
 seed generated ColorSchemes at the same level. Seed generated ColorSchemes already
 mix a bit of their primary color into the generate neutral tonal palettes, that is
 when when using surface blends wit them, they surface coloring gets a lot stronger
 at lower level, since the mixing starts with a hint of the primary in the
 base surface colors already. FlexColorScheme primary color surface mode works
 with seed generated ColorSchemes too, it is however often needed to reduce the
 blend strength. If you want the actual Material 3 default surface blends, then
 keep blend level at zero.

The key color itself is seldom included as a color in the generated `ColorScheme`.
This can be problematic if you want to use that specific color in your
custom scheme for branding purposes. The `FlexKeyColors` configuration data
class contains additional properties where you can instruct it to keep a color
defined in FlexColorScheme at its defined input value. Set e.g.
`keepPrimary: true` to ensure that the actual primary color you used to
seed your color scheme, is also used as the primary color in the otherwise seed
generated ColorScheme from the used color. In the next example we will
demonstrate this as well.
