# Ways to ThemeData

**TODO: Complete this chapter for version 5, it is sill WIP, but progressing!**

In this chapter we compare different ways to define and create a `ThemeData`
object and look at the differences we get in effective **colors** in the theme-
We will look at using these options:

1. ThemeData.light()
2. ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue)
3. ThemeData(colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch())
4. ThemeData(colorScheme: ColorScheme())
5. ThemeData.from(colorScheme: ColorScheme())
6. ThemeData(colorSchemeSeed: Color()),
7. ThemeData(colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Color())),
8. ThemeData.from(colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Color())),
9. FlexThemeData.light(colorScheme)
10. FlexThemeData.light(colorScheme, keyColors)
11. FlexThemeData.light(colorScheme, keyColors, subThemesData)

Then compare the results. Yes that's a lot of methods to make a `ThemeData`
object, last three ones are FlexColorScheme ways with some different parameters.
Recommendations on what to use when will also be given.

## Comparison ColorScheme

To make it interesting we will when possible use
the `ColorScheme` M3 Guide Baseline as input for a full qualified
`ColorScheme`, but a bit neutered since it is as a more Material 2 variant with
less colorful onColors. When we use seeded ColorSchemes with it
we get also the more colorful colors as specified in the M3 guide.

The scheme is useful also because when we use its main color, as seed
color, the algorithm actually produces the same `ColorScheme`, this happens
because colors in M3 Guide Baseline `ColorScheme` has been produced using
the same input Color. This helps us spot differences in the result since we
will not be focused on the color generation differences, but rather on where
the colors end up in the produced `ThemeData`


For reference, used M3 baseline light theme mode `ColorScheme` without
M3 colorful onColors.

```dart
const ColorScheme flexSchemeLight = ColorScheme(
  brightness: Brightness.light,
  primary: Color(0xff6750a4),
  onPrimary: Color(0xffffffff),
  primaryContainer: Color(0xffeaddff),
  onPrimaryContainer: Color(0xff000000),
  secondary: Color(0xff625b71),
  onSecondary: Color(0xffffffff),
  secondaryContainer: Color(0xffe8def8),
  onSecondaryContainer: Color(0xff000000),
  tertiary: Color(0xff7d5260),
  onTertiary: Color(0xffffffff),
  tertiaryContainer: Color(0xffffd8e4),
  onTertiaryContainer: Color(0xff000000),
  error: Color(0xffb00020),
  onError: Color(0xffffffff),
  errorContainer: Color(0xfffcd8df),
  onErrorContainer: Color(0xff000000),
  outline: Color(0xff4d4d4d),
  background: Color(0xffffffff),
  onBackground: Color(0xff000000),
  surface: Color(0xffffffff),
  onSurface: Color(0xff000000),
  surfaceVariant: Color(0xffffffff),
  onSurfaceVariant: Color(0xff000000),
  inverseSurface: Color(0xff121212),
  onInverseSurface: Color(0xffffffff),
  inversePrimary: Color(0xfff0e9ff),
  shadow: Color(0xff000000),
);
```

For reference used M3 baseline dark theme mode `ColorScheme` without
M3 colorful onColors

```dart
const ColorScheme flexSchemeDark = ColorScheme(
  brightness: Brightness.dark,
  primary: Color(0xffd0bcff),
  onPrimary: Color(0xff000000),
  primaryContainer: Color(0xff4f378b),
  onPrimaryContainer: Color(0xffffffff),
  secondary: Color(0xffccc2dc),
  onSecondary: Color(0xff000000),
  secondaryContainer: Color(0xff4a4458),
  onSecondaryContainer: Color(0xffffffff),
  tertiary: Color(0xffefb8c8),
  onTertiary: Color(0xff000000),
  tertiaryContainer: Color(0xff633b48),
  onTertiaryContainer: Color(0xffffffff),
  error: Color(0xffcf6679),
  onError: Color(0xff000000),
  errorContainer: Color(0xffb1384e),
  onErrorContainer: Color(0xffffffff),
  outline: Color(0xffb3b3b3),
  background: Color(0xff121212),
  onBackground: Color(0xffffffff),
  surface: Color(0xff121212),
  onSurface: Color(0xffffffff),
  surfaceVariant: Color(0xff121212),
  onSurfaceVariant: Color(0xffffffff),
  inverseSurface: Color(0xffffffff),
  onInverseSurface: Color(0xff000000),
  inversePrimary: Color(0xff635b70),
  shadow: Color(0xff000000),
);
```

### ThemeData ColorSwatch

Let's call this group ThemeData ColorSwatch based, since they all either
directly or under the hood via defaults use the old Material 2 ColorSwatch
to create `ThemeData` and its colors.

These methods can be considered obsolete when it comes to producing
`ColorScheme` using `ThemeData`. Some of them don't even accept a
`ColorScheme` as input nor do they produce a very usable `ColorScheme`.
The methods are no deprecated, but it is stated in source code comments that
these are not the preferred way to make color correct ThemeData. further
below we will see why.

Since the methods do not accept a `ColorScheme` as input, we will use the
old classic Material swatch as input, and we will use `Colors.blue`, which
is also the default one many of the use if one is not provided.

We start with `ThemeData.light()` and `ThemeData.dark()`. These are just
small convenience factories made with this code:

```dart
  /// A default light blue theme.
  factory ThemeData.light() => ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.light);
  /// A default dark theme with a teal secondary [ColorScheme] color.
  factory ThemeData.dark() => ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.dark);
```

These shortcuts are in fact only marginally shorter then using the syntax used
for what they return, unclear why they exits, but they do. They mostly
inconvenient when you make a `ThemeData` object, since you cannot define any
other properties for them directly, you would have to apply all of them with
`copyWith`. Still If we create our `ThemeData` like this:

```dart
theme: ThemeData.light(),
darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(),
```

We can conclude that it is identical to this:
```dart
theme: ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.light),
darkTheme: ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.dark),
```
Except with the above syntax we could have specified any of `ThemeData`'s myriad
of other properties to actually make a useable `ThemeData`object.

We could e.g. have specified a swatch. Let's do that, but OK let's use the well
known blue swatch. Which is also identical to the above, since the default
old Material 2 primarySwatch is the blue one:

```dart
theme: ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.light,
  primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
),
darkTheme: ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.dark,
  primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
),
```

You can also create a ThemeData from a `ColorScheme` that is created from
a Material 2 ColorSwatch. Let's do it with the blue swatch and see if we can
spot any differences:

```dart
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch(
    brightness: Brightness.light,
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
  ),
),
darkTheme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch(
    brightness: Brightness.dark,
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
  ),
),
```

Let's check out what the colors for these looks like:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>ThemeData.light()/dark()</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>ThemeData(brightness: light/dark)</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>

## ThemeData ColorScheme

Making `ThemeData` colors by defining a `ColorScheme` is the recommend way today.
But there are many wat to make `ThemeData` with `ColorScheme` as well.
What are their differences? Let's take a look at that.

We can just use `ThemeData` with a fully specified `ColorScheme`, like so:

```dart
theme: ThemeData(colorScheme: flexSchemeLight),
darkTheme: ThemeData(colorScheme: flexSchemeDark),
```

Or does it matter if we use the `ThemeData.from` a `ColorScheme` factory like so:

```dart
theme: ThemeData.from(colorScheme: flexSchemeLight),
darkTheme: ThemeData.from(colorScheme: flexSchemeDark),
```

If we want to make a seeded `ColorScheme` and use `ThemeData` property
`colorSchemeSeed`, this is one way:

```dart
theme: ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.light,
  colorSchemeSeed: const Color(0xff6750a4),
),
darkTheme: ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.dark,
  colorSchemeSeed: const Color(0xff6750a4),
),
```

Again, how is this different from using:

```dart
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: const Color(0xff6750a4),
    brightness: Brightness.light,
  ),
),
darkTheme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: const Color(0xff6750a4),
    brightness: Brightness.dark,
  ),
),
```

Or a `ThemeData.from` with a `ColorScheme.fromSeed`, like so:

```dart
theme: ThemeData.from(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: const Color(0xff6750a4),
    brightness: Brightness.light,
  ),
),
darkTheme: ThemeData.from(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: const Color(0xff6750a4),
    brightness: Brightness.dark,
  ),
),
```

If all these options are confusing, it is because it that is so.

Let's look at the results:

**TODO: Add comparison images and explain cause of differences**


## ThemeData FlexColorScheme

Next we will compare all the above to what FlexColoScheme produces with same
setup. We can use a fully specified `ColorScheme` as input to `FlexColorScheme`
to create custom themes with it too.

This can be used instead a the `colors` property. The `colors` property is
convenient, since we do not have to
specify all the colors in a `ColorScheme`. FlexColorScheme wil instead handle
the nuances of making one, based on other properties we specify in the
factory, like blends, app bar setup, etc, plus using defaults and computational
colors it will make its own version of a fully specified `ColorScheme` when
it produces its `ThemeData`. Using key colors for the seed generated `ColorScheme`
is another computational `ColorScheme` generation method.

However, in this case we want to use the exact same input `ColorScheme`, so
we can compare the result by using the same input `ColorScheme` like so:

```dart
theme: FlexThemeData.light(colorScheme: flexSchemeLight),
darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(colorScheme: flexSchemeDark),
```

Next, we add the identical seed generated `ColorScheme` as above where we
used `ColorScheme.fromSeed`, by turning on using keyColors, we just pass in
the default setup, which uses the primary color and the same algorithm that
the `ColorScheme.fromSeed` used when we used it with the `primary` color
from our `ColorScheme`.

```dart
theme: FlexThemeData.light(
  colorScheme: flexSchemeLight,
  keyColors: const FlexKeyColors(),
),
darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
  colorScheme: flexSchemeDark,
  keyColors: const FlexKeyColors(),
),
```

Lastly we will enable the opinionated component sub-themes, however to not
get stuck on the differences in border radius and shape of the FAB, let's make
it look like Material 2 for this comparison.

```dart
theme: FlexThemeData.light(
  colorScheme: flexSchemeLight,
  keyColors: const FlexKeyColors(),
  subThemesData: const FlexSubThemesData(
    defaultRadius: 4,
    fabUseShape: false,
  ),
  fontFamily: GoogleFonts.roboto().fontFamily,
),
darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
  colorScheme: flexSchemeDark,
  keyColors: const FlexKeyColors(),
  subThemesData: const FlexSubThemesData(
    defaultRadius: 4,
    fabUseShape: false,
  ),
  fontFamily: GoogleFonts.roboto().fontFamily,
),
```
