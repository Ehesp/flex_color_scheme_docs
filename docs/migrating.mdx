# Migrating to version 5.0

FlexColorScheme version 5.0 is style wise a big breaking change since all the
built `ColorScheme` have been revised to follow the new Material 3 style guide.
The color have however been kept minimal compared to previous style, mostly
new color values were added to provide support for all the new colors
in the Flutter Material 3 `ColorScheme` update included in Flutter 2.10.

Version 5 requires minimum Flutter version 2.10 to work, this in itself is a
big breaking change. It is however needed since the new color properties
in `ColorScheme` do not exist in stable version of Flutter before version 2.10.


## What are the minimum required changes and how do I migrate?

Just like `ColorScheme.primaryVariant` and `secondaryVariant` have been deprecated
in Flutter 2.10 SDK, so have they in FlexColorScheme. In fact all past color constants
for all color values and helper classes with the name "variant" in it, have been
deprecated in FlexColorScheme. The color values still exists, so if you have used
any of them directly, they will still work. The old internal variant color values will
remain at least until version 6.0, maybe even 7.0 if needed.


### Breaking: Removed `surfaceStyle`

Removed in version 4.2.0 deprecated property `surfaceStyle`, including all
its implementing classes, enums, helpers and tests:

* Removed property: surfaceStyle in FlexColorScheme.light and FlexSchemeData.light.
* Removed property: surfaceStyle in FlexColorScheme.dark and FlexSchemeData.dark.
* Removed: enum FlexSurface, that surfaceStyle where.
* Removed: factory FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.from that was used to create
  surface using the FlexSurface. The factory FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.blend
  replaced it in version 4.0.0 already, when using surfaceMode and blendLevel.

**Migration:** Use `surfaceMode` and `blendLevel` instead.

### Breaking: No function `FlexColorScheme.useSubThemes`

Deprecated property useSubThemes. This property has no function after 4.2.0
stable and 5.0.0-dev.1. Previously setting this property to true activated
the default set and configuration of the optional opinionated component sub-themes.
It actually did so internally by creating and using a default constructor
`FlexSubThemesData()` and using it internally if one was not defined and ignored
any assigned one if the flag was set to false.

The default component sub-theme are now instead activated and created by
explicitly assigning a default constructor `FlexSubThemesData()` to
`FlexColorScheme.subThemesData`.

**Migration:** If you previously had only set `FlexColorScheme.useSubThemes` to true and not
specified any `subThemesData`, you must now add the default constructor.
The flag `useSubThemes` can be removed.

Deprecating this property makes the API more consistent. It now follows the same
design that is used for the new `keyColors` with `FlexKeyColors` and
`tones` with `FlexTones`. Setting the property useSubThemes will not cause an
error, it just has no effect. You can safely remove it.
The property `useSubThemes` will be removed completely in release 6.0.

### Breaking: Completely removed `FlexSubThemesData.navigationBarIsStyled`

The property `navigationBarIsStyled` in `FlexSubThemesData` has been
removed. It has a broader more general replacement called
`FlexSubThemesData.useFlutterDefaults`.

**Migration:** Consider using `useFlutterDefaults` instead or set style manually
using individual properties to desired style matching Flutter defaults un-themed
component designs.

### Potentially breaking: enum SchemeColor, new values, new order

The enum SchemeColor has new values and past values are in a new order.
The order was changed to accommodate new color values and to keep them in
the same order as their corresponding color properties in M3 `ColorScheme`
color values. The change of order is potentially breaking, but unlikely to
break anything in major ways, other than possibly local storage of
selected enum values.

### Breaking style `primaryVariant` and `secondaryVariant`

The colors `primaryVariant` and `secondaryVariant` in FlexColorScheme are
deprecated and can no longer be used to set colors values that result in any
color change on in Flutter SDK deprecated same named `ColorScheme` properties.
In fact the `ColorScheme` deprecated properties `primaryVariant` and
`secondaryVariant` will only default to their default values in Flutter,
regardless of what input you give to them FlexColorScheme. Flutter sets its
deprecated `primaryVariant` equal to ``primary` and `secondaryVariant` equal
to `secondary`. This means that is your have in your application used those
color scheme values on any custom widgets, their colors will change if
you upgrade from a previous version of FlexColorScheme and don't do any
other changes. You need to migrate to use `primaryContainer`,
`secondaryContainer`, `tertiary` or `tertiaryContainer` color, as replacement
colors in your custom widgets. Which one to use, depends on your color design.

When you use a `FlexColorScheme` setup made for a version before version 5.0,
with version 5.0, and
- if you have used custom color schemes where you defined the
   `FlexColorScheme` properties `primaryVariant` and `secondaryVariant`
- or used them via a custom `FlexSchemeColors` for the `colors` property in
`FlexColorScheme`.

In those cases the color properties will function as fallback input for color
properties `primaryContainer` and `secondaryContainer` respectively, unless own
color values for these properties have been provided.

If you just upgrade package version to 5.0.0 and have used custom color schemes,
you will thus find your custom variant colors on the corresponding new
container colors.

Be aware though that past variant color saturation are not necessarily a great
fit for a Material 3 design, but at least you will get your past custom colors
used in the theme by default.

**Migration:** Define new custom colors values for all container colors and
tertiary color. Use them to make your custom `FlexColorScheme` instead.
The migrate away from using Flutter SDK `ColorScheme` colors `primaryVariant`
and `secondaryVariant` on anywhere in your application. Instead use the new
`ColorScheme` color properties as fitting with your design.

## Using built-in themes

To use the built-in M3 based theme design, you don't have to migrate anything.
All built-in schemes have been migrated to provide color values for all the 
new Material 3 `ColorScheme` color properties.

This migration was done as follows:

 - primary, same color as before.
 - primaryContainer, this is a new color value added to all built-in schemes.
 - secondary, same color as before.
 - secondaryContainer, this is a new color value added to all built-in schemes.
 - tertiary, this is the same color as past secondaryVariant color.
 - tertiaryContainer, this is a new color value added to all built-in schemes.

The new color values follow the same design spirit as the built-in scheme had before, but due to
all the new colors in M# ColorScheme, new values had to be added. The color values used for
past `primaryVariant` did not really fit anywhere in the new M3 design. However, past
color value for `secondaryVariant` was reused as color value for new `tertiary` color.

In M2 design, the variant color was typically a darker color of its primary or secondary parent.
In M3 design, in light theme mode the container color, is intended to be lighter version of its
non container version. In dark mode it is the reverse, container is a dark version of its none
container version. If you are lazy when you make custom light and dark themes, you can actually get
by defining all the primary, secondary, tertiary and their container colors for light theme 
mode, and then if you followed the container's design intent to be a lighter version of its none
container version, you can often for dark mode just swap light mode none container and container
color value from you light mode, and you will get a decent dark mode theme.



# Migrating to version 4.0

The in FlexColorScheme version 3.0 deprecated member `accentColor` was
completely removed, it had no function starting from version 3.0.

There are no other broken properties, however the property `darkIsTrueBlack`
contains a minor breaking style change with previous styles.

 For more information on this and on all the new features, see
 [changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/4.0.0/changelog).


# Migrating to version 3.0

FlexColorScheme property `accentColor` was deprecated, it is still present
but has no function, it will be completely removed in version 4 of FlexColorScheme.
The property was removed because it is going to be removed in Flutter SDK
 `ThemeData` from Flutter version v2.3.0-0.1.pre. Use property `secondaryColor`
 in FlexColorScheme instead.

 For more information on this and on new features, see
 [changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/3.0.0/changelog).


# Migrating to version 2.0

Version 2.0 is the first stable release of FlexColorScheme with null safety.
To migrate to it, you should use Dart SDK version min 2.12 and
perform normal Dart null safety migration of your application.

The in version 1.3.0 deprecated member `FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.themeSurface`,
that was already then replaced with `FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.surfaceStyle` was
completely removed in version 2. If you were still using
`FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.surfaceStyle` change it to
`FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.surfaceStyle`.

This is the only breaking non-nullsafety related features. Other changes are
breaking only in style and described in the
[changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/2.0.0/changelog).
