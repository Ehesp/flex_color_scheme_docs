# Migration Guide

This chapter contains guides for the minimum required changes to move from a lower
major version to the next one.

## Migrating to Version 5.0

FlexColorScheme version 5.0 is style wise a big breaking change since all the
built `ColorScheme` have been revised to follow the new Material 3 style guide.
The color changes have however been kept minimal compared to previous style. Mostly
new color values were added to provide support for all the new colors
in the Flutter Material 3 `ColorScheme` update, included in Flutter 2.10. The new
colors are in style sync with past styles as far possible, while also keeping them
inline with the M3 design intent.

Version 5 requires minimum Flutter version 2.10 to work. This in itself is a
big breaking change. It is however needed since the new color properties
in `ColorScheme` do not exist in stable version of Flutter before version 2.10.

Just like `ColorScheme.primaryVariant` and `secondaryVariant` have been deprecated
in Flutter 2.10 SDK, so have they in FlexColorScheme. In fact all past color constants
for all color values and helper classes with the name "variant" in them, have been
deprecated in FlexColorScheme. The variant color values still exists, so if you have used
any of them directly, they will still work. The old internal variant color values will
remain at least until version 6.0, maybe even 7.0 if needed.

### Breaking: `surfaceStyle` removed

In version 5 the in version 4.2.0 deprecated property `surfaceStyle`, including all
its implementing classes, enums, helpers and tests have been removed.

* Removed property: surfaceStyle in FlexColorScheme.light and FlexSchemeData.light.
* Removed property: surfaceStyle in FlexColorScheme.dark and FlexSchemeData.dark.
* Removed: enum FlexSurface, that surfaceStyle where.
* Removed: factory FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.from that was used to create
  surface using the FlexSurface. The factory FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.blend
  replaced it in version 4.0.0 already, when using surfaceMode and blendLevel.

**Migration:** Use `surfaceMode` and `blendLevel` instead, it has more blend styles and finer
granularity than the removed `surfaceStyle`.

```dart
theme: FlexThemeData.light(
  scheme: FlexScheme.flutterDash,
  surfaceMode: FlexSurfaceMode.highScaffoldLowSurface,
  blendLevel: 20,
),
```

### Breaking: `FlexSubThemesData.navigationBarIsStyled` removed

The property `navigationBarIsStyled` in `FlexSubThemesData` has been
removed. It has a broader more general replacement called
`FlexSubThemesData.useFlutterDefaults`.

**Migration:** Consider using `useFlutterDefaults` instead, or set style manually
using individual properties to desired style matching Flutter defaults un-themed
component designs.

### Breaking: `FlexColorScheme.useSubThemes` no function

Deprecated property `useSubThemes`. This property has no function after 4.2.0
stable and 5.0.0-dev.1. Previously setting this property to true activated
the default set and configuration of the optional opinionated component sub-themes.
It actually did so internally by creating and using a default constructor
`FlexSubThemesData()` and using it internally, if one was not defined and ignored
any assigned one if the flag was set to false.

The default component sub-theme are now instead activated and created by
explicitly assigning a default constructor `FlexSubThemesData()` to
`FlexColorScheme.subThemesData`.

**Migration:** If you previously had only set `FlexColorScheme.useSubThemes` to true and not
specified any `subThemesData` properties, you must now add the default constructor. Likewise,
if you had set `FlexColorScheme.useSubThemes` to false, and had a `FlexColorScheme.subThemesData`
defined, you must remove it disable using it. If you need to toggle it ON and OFF, use a bool
to enabled/disable, pass in the `FlexSubThemesData` when enabled, and null when not using it.

Why was this change made? Deprecating this property makes the API more consistent. It now
follows the same design that is used for the new `keyColors` with `FlexKeyColors`, and
`tones` with `FlexTones`. Setting the property useSubThemes will not cause an
error, it just has no effect. You can safely remove it.
The property `useSubThemes` will be removed completely in release 6.0.


### Beware: `SchemeColor` values and order

The enum `SchemeColor` has new values and past values are in a new order.
The order was changed to accommodate new color values, and to keep them in
the same order as their corresponding color properties in Flutter Material 3 `ColorScheme`
color values. The change of order is potentially breaking, but unlikely to
break anything in major ways.

### Deprecated: `primaryVariant` and `secondaryVariant`

The colors `primaryVariant` and `secondaryVariant` in FlexColorScheme are
deprecated and can no longer be used to set colors values that result in any
color values in Flutter SDK deprecated same named `ColorScheme` color properties.

The `ColorScheme` deprecated properties `primaryVariant` and
`secondaryVariant` will always get their Flutter SDK default values,
regardless of what input you give to them in FlexColorScheme. Flutter sets its
deprecated `primaryVariant` equal to `primary` and `secondaryVariant` equal
to `secondary`.

This means that if your application used those
color scheme values on any custom widgets, their colors will change if
you upgrade from a previous version of FlexColorScheme and don't do any
other changes. You need to migrate to use `primaryContainer`,
`secondaryContainer`, `tertiary` or `tertiaryContainer` color, as replacement
colors in your custom widgets. Which one to use depends on your color design.

If you use a `FlexColorScheme` setup made for a version before version 5.0,
with version 5.0, and
- if you have used custom color schemes where you defined the
   `FlexColorScheme` properties `primaryVariant` and `secondaryVariant`
- or defined and used them via a custom `FlexSchemeColors`, in the `colors` property in
`FlexColorScheme`.

**Then**, in those cases the **variant** color properties will function as fallback
input for color properties `primaryContainer` and `secondaryContainer` respectively, unless own
color values for these properties is provided.

Thus when you upgrade package version to 5.0.0 and have used custom color schemes,
you will find your custom variant colors on the corresponding new
container colors. Be aware though that past variant color shades are not necessarily a great
fit for a Material 3 design intent of container colors, but at least you will get
your past custom colors used in the new theme by default.

**Migration:** Define new custom colors values for all container colors and
tertiary color. Use them to make your custom `FlexColorScheme` instead.
Then migrate away from using Flutter SDK `ColorScheme` colors `primaryVariant`
and `secondaryVariant` anywhere in your application. Instead use the new
`ColorScheme` color properties as fitting with your design. This is something you have
to do after Flutter 2.10, even if you are not using FlexColorScheme. Sure, not immediately, but
eventually when the Flutter SDK `ColorScheme` colors `primaryVariant` and `secondaryVariant`
are removed after a year or so.

### Info: Built-in schemes

To use the updated built-in Material 3 compatible color schemes, you don't have to
migrate anything. All built-in schemes have been migrated to provide
color values for all the new Material 3 `ColorScheme` color properties.

This migration was done as follows:

 - primary, same color as before.
 - primaryContainer, this is a new color value added to all built-in schemes.
 - secondary, same color as before.
 - secondaryContainer, this is a new color value added to all built-in schemes.
 - tertiary, this is the same color value as past `secondaryVariant` color.
 - tertiaryContainer, this is a new color value added to all built-in schemes.

The new color values follow the same design intent the built-in scheme had before, but due to
all the new colors in Material 3 ColorScheme, new values had to be added. The color values used for
past `primaryVariant` did not really fit anywhere in the new M3 design. However, past
color value for `secondaryVariant` was reused as the color value for new `tertiary` color.

In M2 design, the variant color was typically a darker color of its primary or secondary counterpart.
In M3 design in light theme mode, the container color is intended to be a lighter version of its
non container color. In dark mode it is the reverse, container is a darker version of its none
container version. If you are lazy when you make custom light and dark themes, you can actually get
away with defining all the primary, secondary, tertiary and their container colors for your light
theme mode, and then if you followed the container's design intent to be a lighter version of its
none container version, you can often for dark mode just swap light mode none container and container
color value from you light mode, and you will get a fairly decent dark mode theme.

Depending on your settings, FlexColorScheme computes different colors and shades for all the
surface and on colors. You can also choose weather you use the new Material 3 error colors,
instead of the Material 2 based error colors, even if you are not using seed generated M3
color schemes. The past M2 error colors have received some new for FlexColorScheme chosen color
values to fill the gaps in the ColorScheme error colors when using their Material 2 version.
So even it has proper color shades for all container and on colors for both light and dark mode,
they ar slightly different from their Material 3 version and more inline with the Material 2 style.


## Migrating to Version 4.0

The in FlexColorScheme version 3.0 deprecated member `accentColor` was
completely removed, it had no function starting from version 3.0.

There are no other broken properties, however the property `darkIsTrueBlack`
contains a minor breaking style change with previous styles, it now makes surface color 8%
darker instead of 6%.

For more information on this and on all the new features, see
[changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/4.0.0/changelog).


## Migrating to Version 3.0

FlexColorScheme property `accentColor` was deprecated, it is still present
but has no function. Tt will be completely removed in version 4 of FlexColorScheme.
The property was removed because it is going to be removed in Flutter SDK
`ThemeData` from Flutter version v2.3.0-0.1.pre. Use property `secondaryColor`
in FlexColorScheme instead.

For more information on this and on new features, see
[changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/3.0.0/changelog).


## Migrating to Version 2.0

Version 2.0 is the first stable release of FlexColorScheme with null safety.
To migrate to it, you should use minimum Dart SDK version 2.12 and
perform normal Dart null safety migration of your application.

The in version 1.3.0 deprecated member `FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.themeSurface`,
that was already then replaced with `FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.surfaceStyle`, was
completely removed in version 2. If you were still using
`FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.themeSurface` change it to
`FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.surfaceStyle`.

This is the only breaking non-nullsafety related features. Other changes are
breaking only in style and described in the
[changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/versions/2.0.0/changelog).
