# Example Applications

FlexColorScheme comes bundled with seven different examples. A default example that is built
if you build `main.dart` in the example lib folder.

The default example is a template that is heavily commented to guide
you and encourage you to play around with different options in code, then use
Flutter's hot reload feature and see the results at once.

The other five examples are a part of a tutorial path, with increasing
complexity, that we walk through in the tutorial. It ends with the complete
**Themes Playground** demo app included as example 5.

The last example is a copy-paste template that you can use to try copy pasted theme setup code
from the Themes Playground.

## Default Example - Hot Reload Playground

A quick and simple way to try FlexColorScheme V5 is to build the
default example application. You can then use it as a hot reload playground to
experiment with and test different theming and configuration options.

To try the default **example** on a device or simulator,
clone the [repository](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme) and
run the example:

```bash
cd example/
flutter run
```

The result is a demo app that uses Dash color scheme,
has a theme mode switch, includes theme colors presentation
and Material widget samples. With these you can see the active color scheme's
colors and the created theme's impact on common Material UI widgets.

The default sample app, the **Hot Reload Playground**, looks like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>[<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-hot-reload-01R.png?raw=true" alt="Reload1" width="250"/>](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-hot-reload-01R.png?raw=true)</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>

  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td colspan="7"> **_Hot Reload Playground the Default Example App (click images to open hires version)_** </td>
    </tr>
 </table>

It comes fully loaded with template settings and thorough
comments that explain what to change to produce different results. You
could for example change the `_scheme` to `FlexScheme.blueWhale`, as shown below and hot
reload it, to use it as theme instead.

```dart
// To use a pre-defined color scheme, don't assign any FlexSchemeColor to
// `colors`, instead pick a FlexScheme and assign it to the `scheme` property.
// Try eg the new "Blue Whale" color scheme.
const FlexScheme _scheme = FlexScheme.blueWhale;

```

There are many settings you can easily modify in the default example application. They are
excessively commented in order to provide guidance for those that don't read docs and want to
jump right in and start using it.

The results shown above were also produced by editing a few simple properties in the
Hot Reload Playground.


## Building the Examples

You can build the examples by using pre-configured launch and run config files for
VS-Code (.vscode -> launch.json) and Android Studio/IntelliJ
(.run -> *.xml files).

When you have cloned the package repo and open the
project in VS-Code or Android Studio/IntelliJ the configurations should be
available for you, so you can easily build all the examples.

In IntelliJ and Android Studio you can use:
<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/intelliJ-run-file.png?raw=true" alt="intellij-run"/>

_For IntelliJ and Studio there is a .run config that can be used to build and run the examples_

In VS-Code you can use:
<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/vscode-run-file.png?raw=true" alt="vscode-run"/>

_For VS-Code there is a launch.json that can be used to build and run the examples_


## Live WEB Demos of the Examples

**TODO: Review and update IMAGES. Links to new WEB apps are updated.**

If you want to take a quick look at all the tutorial examples, you can try live web
versions of them.

### Example 1 - Basic Theme

[**Example 1**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/basictheme-v5) represents the simplest
use case. To use one of the built-in color schemes as your application theme.
You can toggle between its light and dark variant, or allow device system theme
mode setting to control if the dark or light theme is used.

  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td colspan="5"> **_Example 1) Using a built-in FlexColorScheme color scheme as application theme (click image to open hires version)_** </td>
  </tr>
 </table>


### Example 2 - Custom Theme

[**Example 2**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/customtheme-v5) is like example 1,
but we use custom colors to make a custom color scheme and turn it into a theme.
The architecture is also more advanced, it uses the approach introduced with
Flutter skeleton template, using a theme service and theme controller.
Here we keep settings only in memory using the in memory `ThemeServiceMem`
theme service.

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/22-example-2-a-small.jpg?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 2" />](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/22-example-2-a.png?raw=true)

application theme (click image to open hires version)_

### Example 3 - Four Themes

[**In example 3**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/fourthemes-v5) we can toggle the
active theme between 3 different predefined color schemes, plus the custom one
we defined in example 2. We can also opt in and out of using the new sub theming.

All the settings are persisted locally, using a theme service
called `ThemeServicePrefs`. This service uses the package
[SharedPreferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) to persist
the theme settings locally as they are modified.

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/23-example-3-a-small.jpg?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 3" />](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/23-example-3-a.png?raw=true)
_Example 3) Using three built-in schemes, plus a custom color scheme
as application theme options (click image to open hires version)_

### Example 4 - All Themes

[**In example 4**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/allthemes-v5) we can select any
of the different built-in color schemes plus three custom ones, and
use them as the application theme. In this example we persist the theme
settings using a theme service called `ThemeServiceHive`. It persists the
settings locally using a package called [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive).

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/24-example-4-a-small.jpg?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 4" />](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/24-example-4-a.png?raw=true)
_Example 4) Using custom schemes, plus all the built-in ones as application
theme options (click image to open hires version)_

### Example 5 - Themes Playground

[**Example 5**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5) is the last, and most
complex of the examples. It presents most configuration and
settings available in FlexColorScheme. You can modify them interactively
and the application changes theme as you modify any setting.

In this example we also persist the theme settings as you change any value
and parameter in the app. This is done using the same theme service
`ThemeServiceHive` that was used in example 4. The settings can also be reset
back to their default values.

This example is best seen and tested on a tablet, desktop or desktop web browser,
rather than on a phone. The app certainly works well on a phone sized
canvas too, it is using a **very** responsive design. It is just difficult to
get a good overview of all the settings and theming possibilities and their impact on different,
widgets, while changing the settings on the small phone UI, since you cannot see
everything at the same time as you change property values, but it works very well and the
page view is very nice on phones too.

### Other examples

[**Flexfold demo**](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold)

Another classic example of **FlexColorScheme** usage can be seen in the Flutter
web [**Flexfold demo app**](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold).

<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets/FoldTheme1.gif?raw=true" alt="Flexfold demo"/>

_Flexfold Demo uses FlexColorScheme for its themes._

The live version of the Flexfold demo is still using FlexColorScheme version 3.
Example 5, the **Themes Playground**, has much more theming features
than the Flexfold demo.
