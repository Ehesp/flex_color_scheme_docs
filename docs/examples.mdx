# Example Applications

FlexColorScheme comes bundled with seven different examples. A default example that is built
if you build `main.dart` in the example lib folder.

The default example is a template that is heavily commented to guide
you and encourage you to play around with different options in code, then use
Flutter's hot reload feature and see the results at once.

The other five examples are a part of a tutorial path, with increasing
complexity, that we walk through in the tutorial. It ends with the complete
**Themes Playground** demo app included as example 5.

The last example is a copy-paste template, that you can use to test copy-pasted
theme setup code from the Themes Playground.

## Default Example - Hot Reload Playground

A quick and simple way to try FlexColorScheme is to build the
default example application. You can then use it as a hot reload playground to
experiment with and test different theming and configuration options.

To try the default **example** on a device or simulator,
clone the [repository](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme) and
run the example:

```bash
cd example/
flutter run
```

The result is a demo app that uses the **Flutter Dash** color scheme,
has a theme mode switch, includes theme colors presentation
and Material widget samples. With these you can see the active color scheme's
colors and the created theme's impact on common Material UI widgets.

It is a fully loaded template, that uses a large number of available API options
and thorough comments that explain what to change to produce different results. You
could for example change the `_scheme` to `FlexScheme.blueWhale`, as shown below
and hot reload it, to use it as its theme instead.

```dart
// To use a pre-defined color scheme, don't assign any FlexSchemeColor to
// `colors`, instead pick a FlexScheme and assign it to the `scheme` property.
// Try eg the new "Blue Whale" color scheme.
const FlexScheme _scheme = FlexScheme.blueWhale;

```

There are many properties you can easily modify in the default example application. They are
excessively commented in order to provide guidance for those that want to jump right
in and start trying it out.

The results shown above were all produced by editing a few simple properties in the
**Hot Reload Playground**.

### Theme Extensions

In version 5.1.0 FlexColorScheme added direct support for theme extensions to its API. You use it the
same way as you use it with `ThemeData`. The default example, "The Hot Reload Playground" includes
a simple demonstration of how to use it. In this example it is only used to add a single extra theme color,
that is used to give the heading a color based on this theme extension color. With theme extensions
you can add as many colors and other theme properties as you need, and you can add multiple
different ThemeExtension sub classes as well.

```dart
/// A theme Extension example with a single custom brand color property.
class BrandTheme extends ThemeExtension<BrandTheme> {
  const BrandTheme({
    this.brandColor,
  });
  final Color? brandColor;

  // You must override the copyWith method.
  @override
  BrandTheme copyWith({
    Color? brandColor,
  }) =>
      BrandTheme(
        brandColor: brandColor ?? this.brandColor,
      );

  // You must override the lerp method.
  @override
  BrandTheme lerp(ThemeExtension<BrandTheme>? other, double t) {
    if (other is! BrandTheme) {
      return this;
    }
    return BrandTheme(
      brandColor: Color.lerp(brandColor, other.brandColor, t),
    );
  }
}

// Custom const theme with our brand color in light mode.
const BrandTheme lightBrandTheme = BrandTheme(
  brandColor: Color.fromARGB(255, 8, 79, 71),
);

// Custom const theme with our brand color in dark mode.
const BrandTheme darkBrandTheme = BrandTheme(
  brandColor: Color.fromARGB(255, 167, 227, 218),
);

```

The `lightBrandTheme` is then added to our light theme via `FlexThemeData.light`, like so:

```dart
class _DemoAppState extends State<DemoApp> {
  ThemeMode themeMode = ThemeMode.system;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      theme: FlexThemeData.light(
        ...
        // Add all our custom theme extensions, in this case we only have one.
        extensions: <ThemeExtension<dynamic>>{
          lightBrandTheme,
        },
      ),
   ...
   );
```

Same is done with the `darkBrandTheme` color in `darkTheme` with `FlexThemeData.dark`.

## Building the Examples

You can build the examples by using pre-configured launch and run config files for
VS-Code (.vscode -> launch.json) and Android Studio/IntelliJ
(.run -> *.xml files).

When you have cloned the package repo and opened the
project in VS-Code or Android Studio/IntelliJ, the configurations below should be
available. With them you can easily build all the examples.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="intellij"
  values={[
    {label: 'IntelliJ/Android Studio', value: 'intellij'},
    {label: 'VS-Code', value: 'vscode'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="intellij">
    In IntelliJ and Android Studio you can use:
    [<Image src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/intelliJ-run-file.png?raw=true" alt="intellij-run"

    zoom />](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/intelliJ-run-file.png?raw=true)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="vscode">
    In VS-Code you can use:

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Live WEB Demos of the Examples

If you want to take a quick look at all these tutorial example applications, you can see screenshots of
them as phone builds below. Even better, try their live web versions by clicking on their
respective example link below.

### 1) Basic Theme

[**Example 1**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/basictheme-v5) represents the simplest
use case. To use one of the built-in color schemes as your application theme.
You can toggle between its light and dark variant, or allow device system theme
mode setting to control if the dark or light theme is used.

  </tr>
 </table>


### 2) Custom Theme

[**Example 2**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/customtheme-v5) is like example 1,
but we use custom colors to make a custom color scheme and turn it into a theme.
The architecture is also more advanced, it uses the approach introduced with
Flutter skeleton template, using a theme service and theme controller.
Here we keep settings only in memory using the in memory `ThemeServiceMem`
theme service.

### 3) Four Themes

[**In example 3**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/fourthemes-v5) we can toggle the
active theme between 3 different predefined color schemes, plus the custom one
we defined in example 2. We can also opt in and out of using FlexColorScheme's
opinionated component sub-theming.

All the settings are persisted locally, using a theme service
called `ThemeServicePrefs`. This service uses the package
[SharedPreferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) to persist
the theme settings locally as they are modified.

### 4) All Themes

[**In example 4**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/allthemes-v5) we can select any
of the different built-in color schemes plus three custom ones, and
use them as the application theme. In this example we persist the theme
settings using a theme service called `ThemeServiceHive`. It persists the
settings locally using a package called [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive).

  </tr>
 </table>

### 5) Themes Playground

[**Example 5**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v5) is the last, and most
complex of the examples. It contains almost all configuration and
settings available in FlexColorScheme. You can modify them interactively
and the application changes theme as you modify any setting.

In this example we also persist the theme settings as you change any value
and parameter in the app. This is done using the same theme service
`ThemeServiceHive` that was used in example 4. The settings can also be reset
back to their default values.

This example is best seen and tested on a tablet, desktop native or desktop
web browser, rather than on a phone. The app certainly works well on a phone sized
canvas too, it is using two different **very** responsive designs.
It is however a bit challenging to get a good overview of all the theming
possibilities and their impact on different
widgets, while changing the settings on a phone. You can just not see
so many different widgets the same time when you change theming property values.

However, starting from version 5, the topic based swipe enabled page view is very
nice on phones too and mostly gets around this issue. When used on a canvas about
the size of a tablet in landscape it can even show you the code configuration
in a side-by-side view on each topic page. You can then see how the setup and config
code changes and updates, as you modify settings. This is quite fascinating and
a very convenient way to study the API.

Originally this application was supposed to be only a slightly more complex example than example 4.
However, it has since then grown into a complete companion application for FlexColorScheme.

You can use the live web version to play with theme configurations as much as you like, with
complete customization possibilities of almost every API FlexColorScheme offers. When you
are done, you can copy the configuration setup code for it, and paste it into
your application and start using the exact same theme that you configured in the Themes Playground.

There is a separate chapter with more info and a guide on [how to use the Themes Playground](/playground).

### Other examples

[**Flexfold demo**](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold)

An already classic example of **FlexColorScheme** usage can be seen in the Flutter
web [**Flexfold demo app**](https://rydmike.com/demoflexfold).

<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets/FoldTheme1.gif?raw=true" alt="Flexfold demo"/>

The live version of the Flexfold demo is still using FlexColorScheme version 3.
As can be seen it was very capable already back then. Example 5, the
**Themes Playground** app now has many more options and offers considerably
more advanced theming features than the Flexfold demo ever did.

I would love to feature a few select apps using FlexColorScheme here. If you
have one and would allow and like me to include a mention and screenshot of it here. Then
please drop me some screen shots first in the FlexColorScheme GitHub discussions
[show and tell](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)
section, and we can take it from there.
