# Example 5 - Themes Playground

This example shows how you can use all the built-in color schemes in
FlexColorScheme to define themes from them. How you can set up your own
custom scheme colors, and use them together with the predefined ones. Like the
previous example, this can give you an idea of how you can create your own
complete custom list of color schemes if you do not want to use the predefined
ones.

This example also shows how you can use and vary the surface blend modes, change
the blend strength. You can see how the quick custom AppBar theme and its companion
TabBar theme works. The usage of the true black feature for dark
themes is also demonstrated. Using the optional Windows desktop like tooltip
theme is also shown.

The example includes a responsive side menu, it gives a visual
presentation of what applications that have larger visible surfaces using
surface blends look like. The menu has working click commands that allow you to
show and hide the contents of the cards holding settings and results. On
smaller media this makes it quicker to find interesting parts. There is a choice
that allows you the reset the persisted settings back to their default values.
To make a light/dark mode quick toggle always accessible when you test options
and themes, it is also available on the side menu as a toggle.

In addition to allowing you to opt in and out of using the sub themes, this demo
also allows you to control many sub theming parameters, like adjusting the border
radius on all widgets to some other preferred value. To use the Material 3 (M3)
inspired text theme, different theme options on TextField, among many other
sub theming features.

A subpage is also available that show that the same active theme is also
applied when opening another page. This works because all built-in widgets use
the same inherited theme and use the colors in the theme in predefined ways
by default. This is a good example and explanation of why you should use
the same theme colors for your custom re-usable widgets as their default color
property values. Then theme your application to make it look the way you want
it to look, rather than defining constant color values that you apply
directly to widget color properties.

If you tried the previous examples on an Android device, you might have noticed
that the system navigation bar on Android devices does not change. It is
not themed to have matching background or theme mode that matches the active
application theme as it changes. This example shows how it can be fixed and
that the used method remain in effect when opening a subpage.

The same custom color schemes as in example 4, are also used in this example.
They are not explained here again, please
see [example 4](#example-4---all-themes) for details.

> The full code is not shown below, only highlights.
> Please find the complete example code
> [here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example5).

The `main` start function of the app is the same as in previous example.

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Use a ThemeController, which glues our theme settings to Flutter Widgets.
  //
  // The controller uses an abstract ThemeService interface to get and save the
  // settings. There are 3 implementations available to choose from:
  //
  // 0. ThemeService      - Abstract interface base class, contains defaults
  //                        values and shared storage key value strings.
  // 1. ThemeServiceMem   - Only keeps settings in memory.
  // 2. ThemeServicePrefs - Persist settings locally using SharedPreferences.
  // 3. ThemeServiceHive  - Persist settings locally using Hive.
  //
  // Here we use Hive. The examples are all built using same
  // "example" app. If we use SharedPreferences in more than one of the apps
  // they would use the same storage container and share the settings when you
  // build them locally. By using Hive for most examples, we can change
  // the storage container name for each example. In these demos the
  // SharedPreferences service is only used for example 3, but you can swap in
  // the Hive based one for it as well.

  // The ThemeServiceHive constructor requires a box name, the others do not.
  // The box name is just a file name for the file that stores the settings.
  final ThemeService themeService = ThemeServiceHive('flex_scheme_box_5');
  // Initialize the theme service.
  await themeService.init();
  // Create a ThemeController that uses the ThemeService.
  final ThemeController themeController = ThemeController(themeService);
  // Load all the preferred theme settings, while the app is loading, before
  // MaterialApp is created. This prevents a sudden theme change when the app
  // is first displayed.
  await themeController.loadAll();
  // Run the app and pass in the ThemeController. The app listens to the
  // ThemeController for changes.
  // The ThemeController controls all the myriad of Theme settings used
  // in the demo application and also persists settings with injected
  // ThemeService.
  runApp(DemoApp(themeController: themeController));
}
```

This example has a toggle that allows you to for all the schemes use `toDark`
computed dark schemes, instead of the hand tuned built-in ones. You can then
compare this result to hand-made dark themes. The `toDark` method does a
pretty good job and can even be tuned with a level property.

> If you use the `toDark` method on the last custom scheme, you will not see
any difference, because we already created its dark scheme in this
example with this method. Turning the toggle on for it, computes the same dark
scheme from the same light scheme colors again. There is a slider that
you can use to adjust the white blend level of the `toDark` method.
From its default value of 35%, to be anything from 0...100 %, you can experiment
with it and see what it does.

Additionally, this example includes a toggle that allows you to instead of
using the `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` method, use the standard Flutter
`ThemeData.from` factory to create the theme from the same color scheme
definition. We can use this toggle to see and study the differences
that `FlexThemeData` brings to the standard theme with different settings.

The code for the `MaterialApp` for this complex looking application is actually
very similar and even identical regarding its core principle to example 4.
It is just a large number of `ThemeController` values that we assign
to properties in `FlexThemeData.light` and `FlexThemeData.dark`. Plus many more
UI widgets used to set new values to the controller. The `ThemeService`
persists all the values as we change them, same way as before too. The theme
controller notifies its listeners about the change, still using the same setup
as before in our `MaterialApp` since example 2. The app then just
rebuilds the UI to reflect our new theme settings.

It gets repetitive and rather long to show the details here. It is easier to
read `main` and `MaterialApp` StatelessWidget code [here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/example/lib/example5/main.dart).
It is well commented and explains all its parts well. You can certainly
examine the `HomePage` too, I recommend doing that with an IDE though.
It is beyond the scope of this tutorial to explain all its details,
but mostly it is just simple UI layout code.

The concludes the walk through of example 5. When we build it,
the example starts with the **blue whale** color scheme.

You can try the **FlexColorScheme Themes Playground** example as a Flutter
[web app here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut5).

## Custom Themes and Automatic Flutter Source Code

After the first release of FlexColorScheme v4, example 5 was expanded with
two new major features. This did not require any changes to FlexColorScheme
itself, it was just useful new features in example 5 and the
published live version of it. The new features make the **Themes Playground**
a very useful companion app for FlexColorScheme. It is now possible to use it
to make custom theme setups with totally custom colors, and get the colors and
theme you see, in use in your app with just a few clicks and a bit of
code copy/paste action.

In the updated version of example 5, published as the
[Themes Playground](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut5), these
new features and tools are available:

### Custom Color Scheme
Copy an existing color scheme's colors to a custom scheme, that can then
be modified by using a color picker. In this case by using
[FlexColorPicker](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_picker).
It has an interesting feature that names all colors, a practical copy/paste
color values feature, and it also allows you to enter a color
using its hex RGB color value.


### Get Setup Source Code
The Themes Playground can now also generate the code needed for you to
make the same FlexColorScheme based theme you currently see, in your own app.

Using the **Get the code for this theme** feature, you can just copy and
paste the current seen `FlexColorScheme` configuration from it, to your own
application. Then just use it without even knowing what all the properties do.
You can just go by what looks OK to you in the **Themes Playground**, copy
its setup code and use it as it is. All you have to do is copy the code and
paste it into your app.

You can find an example on how to do in this
[tweet and referenced thread](https://twitter.com/RydMike/status/1461381878494150659).

_Using Themes Playground to Copy Theme Setup Source Code (click image to open hires version)_

This is the first version of this code copy/paste feature to get the
configuration code for the shown FlexColorScheme based theme. A small bit
of inception going on here, basically using FlexColorScheme to generate
code for using FlexColorScheme. If you notice any issues with it,
please open an issue in the repo.
