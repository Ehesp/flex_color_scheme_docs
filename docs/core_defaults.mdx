# Core Defaults

This chapter describes the `ThemeData` modifications `FlexColorScheme` core does
when you use it without opting in on the opinionated component themes.

**FlexColorScheme** does not use the `ThemeData.from` factory with a passed
in `ColorScheme` to make its `ThemeData` object. It uses the `ThemeData` factory directly, with
many additional custom theming tweaks.

It of course defines a `ColorScheme` that it uses in its
`ThemeData`. FlexColorScheme uses color calculations for the primary color branded/blended
surfaces, and for the lazy schemes that do not specify all colors in a color scheme.
It utilizes the [Material Color Utilities](https://pub.dev/packages/material_color_utilities)
from the Google Material theme that Flutter SDK also uses, to make key colors seed
generated computational color schemes. It extends the new M3 `CorePalette` in the
Material Color Utilities to be able to tweak the `ColorScheme` generation
parameters in it. It also uses its own custom mid-layer Scheme implementation, with
customizable Tone to ColorScheme mapping.

Most other things it does are more basic, it is just a lot of moving parts.
However, when just using the core, and not opting in on additional component
themes, it is a bit less. Some component themes are however also created by the
core setup, they are listed further below.

## Design Goals

Flutter's default Theme and its ThemeData use a design where all the component theme's in the default
ThemeData are NULL. It is always the widget component that defines the default behavior and look when its
theme and its properties are undefined. The widget colors for such cases are then typically
defined by `ThemeData.colorScheme`.

This Flutter theming design goal is described in this
[document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kzIOQN4QYfVsc5lMZgy_A-FWGXBAJBMySGqZqsJytcE). It is
partially implemented, but there are still be some components in Flutter remaining that do
not fully adhere to this design. And many color properties still remain in `ThemeData`.

FlexColorScheme sets its defined and computed scheme to the `ThemeData.colorScheme` to
ensure that its colors are applied to all widgets that adhere to this newer standard.

Then it also sets all still existing legacy direct colors in `ThemeData`, that some Flutter Widgets
still use. These `ThemeData` colors are all set to use `ColorScheme` appropriate colors, or from it
derived colors. Thanks to this, there will not be any built-in Widgets in Flutter that do not
get color themed by FlexColorScheme. As we can see in [Roads to ThemeData](theming_roads) this
is not the case with Flutter's own ColorScheme based theming methods, you have to
adjust it a bit manually as well.

The ThemeData created by core FlexColorScheme tries to not create and modify component themes when it does not
have to. However, to meet its original design goals, FlexColorScheme still has to create a few sub-themes and set some
of their properties. In some rare cases this is done to correct theming issues in Flutter SDK, but mostly to
reach its own design goals. Below is a list of all the component themes it creates and properties that you can
**currently** expect to have none null values in them. These component themes and their properties,
would otherwise be null when just using default `ThemeData()` or `ThemeData.from()` factories, if they
did not specify any component themes.

Even if some component themes are currently not null, and have some none null properties in FlexColorScheme
based `ThemeData`, you should still always use null fallback values when you access use ThemeData sub-themes and
their properties in `Theme.of(context)` that are null in default `ThemeData`, or any of its component themes.

For example, when using the AppBar's theme data, don't just use:

```dart
final Color aColor = Theme.of(context).appBarTheme.backgroundColor;
```

It should not be considered **safe** to access properties like it without using null fallbacks.
Instead, do something similar to this:

```dart
final Color aColor = Theme.of(context)?.appBarTheme?.backgroundColor ??
  Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary;
```

**FlexColorScheme** will try to not change past creation of its none null sub-themes. However, changes to these
implementation details are only considered breaking if they produce a theme that is visibly different from
past behavior.

**Flutter SDK** may also change some of its implementation details of `ThemeData`. Take for example the broken
`Chip` case, if it is modified to fix its dark theme bug, then FlexColorScheme might have no reason
for its own fix. In cases where Flutter defaults moves in a direction that makes a custom definition for it
no longer needed in FlexColorScheme, such core sub-theme definitions will eventually be
removed from its core component themes, but not without due deprecation warning first.

One past such case was the `floatingActionButtonTheme` sub-theme that FlexColorScheme created in earlier
versions. The used sub-theme did not change Flutter's default behavior. However, in some older versions of
Flutter there was a deprecation warning if the sub-theme was not defined. Later it was
observed that Flutter SDK default and FlexColorScheme sub-theme agreed 100% on the design. There was
no longer any deprecation warning if the sub-theme was totally removed from FlexColorScheme's theme definition.
This sub-theme definition was thus no longer needed and was removed starting from FlexColorScheme
version 2.0.0-nullsafety.2. Another similar change was the deprecation of `ThemeData.accentColor`.

## Core Component Themes

Here are all the component themes that core **FlexColorScheme** currently
defines:

* **AppBarTheme** in `ThemeData.appBarTheme` is NOT null.
  The actual values are defined to match the offered convenience theming options for the AppBar.
  The property values depend on made configuration choices.
    * backgroundColor: *Depends on chosen `appBarStyle`.*
    * foregroundColor: Black if brightness of backgroundColor is light otherwise white.
    * iconTheme: Not null, defines:
        * color: : *Depends on chosen `appBarStyle`.*
    * actionsIconTheme: Not null, defines:
        * color: : *Depends on chosen `appBarStyle`.*
    * elevation: *As defined, default is 0*
    * systemOverlayStyle: *A custom SystemUiOverlayStyle is defined*
    * backwardsCompatibility: `false`

* **BottomAppBarTheme** in `ThemeData.bottomAppBarTheme` is NOT null.
    * Color: `colorScheme.background`
    * elevation: *As defined, default is 0*

* **TextSelectionThemeData** in `ThemeData.bottomAppBarTheme` is NOT null.
    * selectionColor: `dark ? primary.withOpacity(0.50) : primary.withOpacity(0.30)`
    * selectionHandleColor: `primaryColorDark`

* **InputDecorationTheme** in `ThemeData.inputDecorationTheme` is NOT null.
    * filled: `true`
    * fillColor: `dark ? primary.withOpacity(0.06) : primary.withOpacity(0.35)`

* **ButtonThemeData** in `ThemeData.buttonTheme` is NOT null.
    * colorScheme: `colorScheme`
    * textTheme: `ButtonTextTheme.primary`
    * materialTapTargetSize: `MaterialTapTargetSize.shrinkWrap`
    * padding: `EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16)`

* **ChipThemeData** in `ThemeData.chipTheme` is NOT null.
  It was originally defined to fix issue [#65663](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65663) and uses
  `ChipThemeData.fromDefaults` to set:
    * secondaryColor: `colorScheme.primary`
    * brightness: `colorScheme.brightness`
    * labelStyle: `textTheme.bodyText1`

* **TabBarTheme** in `ThemeData.tabBarTheme` is NOT null.
  Its colors depend on if a theme appropriate for current active AppBar background color (default), or one for
  background and surface color usage is selected. It sets:
    * indicatorSize: `TabBarIndicatorSize.tab`
    * labelStyle: `TextTheme().button`
    * labelColor: *Depends on selected and targeted main usage.*
    * unselectedLabelColor: *Depends on selected and targeted main usage*.

* **BottomNavigationBarThemeData** in `ThemeData.bottomNavigationBarTheme` is NOT null.
    * selectedIconTheme: Not null, defines:
        *  color: `colorScheme.primary`
    * selectedItemColor: `colorScheme.primary`

* **TooltipThemeData** in `ThemeData.tooltipTheme` is NOT null. This theme is
  modified to address issue [#71429](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/71429) and
  to also enable a toggle that inverts the tooltip colors, which is a style often
  used on Windows desktops. The toggle can e.g. be used to change the style depending on the current platform.
  The used logic and theme changes are defined as.
    * margin: `EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 12, vertical: 6)`
    * padding: `desktop ? EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(8, 3, 8, 4) : EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16, vertical: 8)`
    * textStyle:
      ```dart
      textTheme.bodyText2.copyWith(
        inherit: false,
        color: tooltipsMatchBackground
           ? dark ? Colors.white : Colors.black
           : dark ? Colors.black : Colors.white,
        fontSize: desktop ? 12 : 14)
      ```
    * decoration:
      ```dart
      tooltipsMatchBackground
        ? BoxDecoration(
           color: isDark ? const Color(0xED444444) : const Color(0xF0FCFCFC),
           borderRadius: const BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(4)),
           border: Border.all(color: dividerThemeColor))
       : null // Use default Flutter SDK decoration.
      ```

## Core ThemeData Customizations

In addition to the primary color branded surfaces, full shaded schemes from just one primary color, true
black and AppBar convenience tricks. The returned `ThemeData` contains some opinionated modifications and theme
modifications compared to what you get if you would just use the standard `ThemeData.from` a `ColorScheme`.

You can still of course override the returned `ThemeData` with your own theme modifications and
additions, by using the `copyWith` method on the resulting `ThemeData` object.

The following lists the differences, compared to the standard `ThemeData.from` factory,
as well as the rationale behind the made design choices and changes to the defaults.

* **scaffoldBackgroundColor** has its own color property in `FlexColorScheme`
  and can if so desired differ from the `ColorScheme.background`
  color. When using primary color blended surfaces and backgrounds, it
  is important to be able to vary the very prominent `ScaffoldBackgroundColor`
  separately from other surfaces and backgrounds.

* The **dialogBackgroundColor** uses the `ColorScheme.surface` color
  instead of the default `ColorScheme.background`. In order to preserve the
  `elevationOverlayColor` in dark mode when `ColorScheme.surface` and
  `ColorScheme.background` differs due to different surface blends, the
  `ColorScheme.surface` was used to ensure dialogs that are always elevated
  gets the overlay color applied in dark theme mode. For more info see
  [issue #90353](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/90353).

* The **indicatorColor** is same as `effectiveTabColor`. It uses a function with
  logic to determine its color based on if a `TabBarTheme` was selected that should
  work on current `AppBar` background color, or on surface/background colors.

* For **toggleableActiveColor** the `ColorScheme.secondary` color is used.
  The Flutter default just uses the default `ThemeData` colors and
  not the actual colors you define in the `ColorScheme` you create your
  theme from. Perhaps an oversight in Flutter?
  See issue [#65782](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65782).
  Also see practical examples in [Roads to ThemeData](/theming_roads).
  This color property will be deprecated in Flutter, see issue
  [91772](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91772).

* Flutter themes created with `ThemeData.from` do not define any color
  scheme related color for the **primaryColorDark** color, FlexColorScheme
  does. See issue [#65782](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65782).
  The `ThemeData.from` leaves this color at `ThemeData` factory default,
  this may not match your scheme. Flutter SDK Widgets seldom use this color,
  so the issue is rarely seen.
  This color property will be deprecated in Flutter, see issue
  [91772](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91772).

* Flutter themes created with `ThemeData.from` do not define any color
  scheme based color for the **primaryColorLight** color, FlexColorScheme does.
  See issue [#65782](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65782).
  The `ThemeData.from` leaves this color at `ThemeData` factory default
  this may not match your scheme. Flutter SDK Widgets seldom use this color,
  so the issue is rarely seen.
  This color property will be deprecated in Flutter, see issue
  [91772](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91772).

* Flutter themes created with `ThemeData.from` do not define any color
  scheme based color for the **secondaryHeaderColor** color, FlexColorScheme
  does. See issue [#65782](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65782).
  `ThemeData.from` leaves this color at `ThemeData` factory default this
  may not match your scheme. Flutter SDK Widgets seldom use this color,
  so the issue is rarely seen.
  This color property will be deprecated in Flutter, see issue
  [91772](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91772).

* Background color for **AppBarTheme** can use a custom themed color
  in both light and dark themes, that is not dependent on the theme's
  primary or surface color.
  In the versions prior to Flutter 2.0.0 doing this was very difficult to do,
  as presented in [#50606](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/50606).
  A new feature in Flutter 2.0.0 implemented via:
  [#71184](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/71184) makes this easy and
  better. FlexColorScheme's implementation has been changed to use this
  new AppBarTheme feature starting from version 2.0.0-nullsafety.2.

* The **AppBarTheme** elevation defaults to 0, an iOs style influenced
  opinionated choice. It can easily be adjusted directly in the
  `FlexColorScheme` definition with property value `appBarElevation`
  without creating a sub theme or using `copyWith`.

* The **bottomAppBarColor** uses color scheme background color to match the
  background color of the drawer, bottom navigation bar, possible side
  menu and system navigation bar on android, if theming of it is used.
  This is a slight change from the ColorScheme default that uses
  surface color.

* The **BottomAppBarTheme** elevation defaults to `appBarElevation` or 0 if
  it is null. It can easily be adjusted directly in the
  `FlexColorScheme` definition with property value `bottomAppBarElevation`
  without creating a sub theme or using `copyWith`.

* In **TextSelectionThemeData**, the Flutter default for **selectionColor** is
  `colorScheme.primary` with opacity value `0.4` for dark-mode and `0.12`
  for light mode. Here, **primary with 0.5 opacity** for dark-mode, and **`0.3`** for
  light mode is used. The default for **selectionHandleColor** is
  `colorScheme.primary`, here we use the slightly darker shade
  **primaryColorDark** instead, which does not have a proper color
  scheme color value in Flutter standard `ColorScheme` based themes.

* A predefined slightly opinionated **InputDecorationTheme** is used. It
  sets `filled` to `true` and fill color to color scheme primary color
  with opacity `0.035` in light mode and with opacity `0.06` in dark-mode.
  Since the used theme, does not define a `border` property of `TextField`,
  an app can easily use both the default underline style, or the
  outline style by just specifying `OutlineInputBorder()`,
  when an outlined `TextField` is desired.
  If you don't want the filled style, or the primary colored
  borders in dark-mode, you can override them back with `copyWith`.

* The property **fixTextFieldOutlineLabel** is set to `true` by default,
  it looks better. The only reason why it is not the default in Flutter,
  is for default backwards legacy design compatibility.

* **NOTE:**
  Since the old buttons have been deprecated in Flutter 2.0.0
  they are no longer presented or used in code in FlexColorScheme and its
  examples. However, FlexColorScheme still defines the theme for
  them described below. Defining the theme does not yet cause any
  deprecation warnings or errors, as long as that is the case, this
  theming will be kept available to support out of the box nice themes for
  the old buttons as before. It is however stated and noted in master
  channel that the next release (after 2.10) of Flutter will completely
  remove the old buttons and the old `buttonTheme` will then be deprecated
  and later removed as well. It FlexColorScheme will then need to deprecate
  and remove the old button theme.

* Button theming is applied to **ThemeData.buttonColor** using color
  `colorScheme.primary` color.

* For **ThemeData.buttonTheme** the entire color scheme is passed to its
  `colorScheme` property, and it uses `textTheme` set to
  `ButtonTextTheme.primary`, plus minor changes to padding and tap target
  size. These modifications make the old buttons almost match the
  default design and look of their corresponding newer buttons.
  The `RaisedButton` looks very similar to `ElevatedButton`,
  `OutlineButton` to `OutlinedButton` and `FlatButton` to `TextButton`.
  There are some differences in margins and minor details, especially in
  dark-mode, but they are very similar.

* The default theme for Chips contain a design bug that makes the
  selected **ChoiceChip** widget look disabled in dark-mode, regardless
  if was created with `ThemeData` or `ThemeData.from` factory.
  See issue [#65663](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65663).
  The **ChipThemeData** modification used here fixes the issue.

* For **TabBarTheme**, the Flutter standard selected tab and indicator
  color is onSurface in dark-mode and onPrimary in light mode, which is
  designed to fit an AppBar colored TabBar. This is kept, and the default
  via `FlexTabBarStyle.forAppBar` style, with a minor modification. If
  AppBar is "light", then black87 is used, not black, this is the same as
  the textTheme on AppBar in light AppBar brightness.
  If the `FlexTabBarStyle.forBackground` style was used, the
  selected color is always color scheme primary color, which works well
  on surface, background and scaffold background colors.

  The unselected TabBar color when `FlexTabBarStyle.forBackground` style
  is used, is always the onSurface color with 60% opacity. This is also
  the color if the AppBar background color brightness is light AND its
  color is white, surface or background colored.
  When the style `FlexTabBarStyle.forAppBar` is used, the
  unselected tab bar color is the selected tab color with 70% opacity.
  This opacity value is the same as Flutter default for the default
  theme that is also designed for AppBar usage.

* The **BottomNavigationBarThemeData** uses color scheme primary color for
  the selected item in both light and dark theme mode. Flutter default uses
  primary in light mode, but defaults to secondary color in dark mode. Primary
  color is a design used on iOS by default for the bottom navigation bar in
  both theme modes. We agree and think it looks better as the default
  choice for apps in both theme modes.

* Default **tooltipTheme** in Flutter is currently a bit flawed on desktop
  and web, because it defaults to using a very small font (10dp).
  See issue [#71429](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/71429).
  The default theming also does not handle multiline tooltips very well.
  The here used `TooltipThemeData` theme design, corrects both these
  issues. It uses 12dp font on desktop and web instead of 10dp,
  and some padding instead of a height constraint to ensure that
  multiline tooltips look nice too.

* FlexColorScheme tooltips also include a boolean property
  **tooltipsMatchBackground**, that can be toggled to not use Flutter's
  Material default design that has a theme mode
  inverted background. Tooltips using light background in light theme
  and dark in dark, are commonly used on the Windows desktop platform.
  You can easily tie this extra property to the used platform to make an automatic
  platform adaptation of the tooltip style if you like. You can also use it
  to give users a preference toggle where they change the tooltip
  style to their liking.

* The FlexColorScheme property **transparentStatusBar** is set to true by default. It is
  used to make the AppBar one-toned on Android devices, like on iOS devices.
  Set it to `false` if you want to restore the default Android two toned design.

## Optional Component Themes

FlexColorScheme also offers highly opinionated widget component themes that
enables you to get more heavily styled and themed widgets automatically. You
can customize these styles further via
[FlexSubThemesData](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemesData-class.html).

These component themes are as stated *opinionated* design choices.
You may or may not like them. They can be modified and tuned, some of them only
a bit, while others offer quite extensive quick configuration options. The intent
is to keep the component themes visual results consistent from version to version.
However, changes in the SDK and supporting new features may require minor
style breaking changes to them from time to time.

The defaults for these mostly still Flutter Material 2 based using component themes,
draw inspiration from Material 3. Their defaults follow the
[Material 3 Design Guide](https://m3.material.io/),
within reasonable limits of current Flutter Material 2 based theming capabilities.

The component themes will be modified and extended when Material 3 features
reaches Flutter stable channel, to use actual Material 3 implementations in
Flutter. Since Material 3 will eventually become the new normal,
FlexColorScheme component themes will potentially make some opinionated design
choices concerning them in future versions, this remains to be seen.

To enable the optional component theming feature in `FlexColorScheme`, pass in
a default `FlexSubThemesData()` to its `subThemesData` property.
This gives you the `FlexColorScheme` default opinionated component theme setup.
Naturally `FlexColorScheme` would not be "flex" if the
[`FlexSubThemesData`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemesData-class.html)
data class did not also contain many optional quick configuration parameters
for the component themes.

The list of properties in the configuration class has grown very large.
While it can be a bit tricky to maintain it, using it is easy and quite
a convenient way to adjust commonly used properties on UI component
widget themes using simple "flat" property values.
No need for deep `ShapeBorder` definitions one very component theme for a
simple border radius change, nor for the complex `MaterialState` properties.
At least not as long as choices and offered flat config options covers
what you need.

A common use case for `FlexSubThemes` and is easy to
use customization of default border radius on **all** Flutter UI components
and elements that supports border radius either via [ShapeBorder]
or [BorderRadiusGeometry]. This is be done with a single property, the
[`defaultRadius`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemesData/defaultRadius.html).

When you opt-in on using the component themes, the `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` method uses
the passed in `FlexSubThemesData` configuration data object, passed in via
`FlexColorScheme.subThemesData`, to create the component themes.

In some cases, typically for older core related "legacy" component theme cases,
the themes are created directly in the `toTheme` method.
However, in most cases separate static sub-theme helper functions
from the `FlexSubThemes` class are used. The component themes that are only defined
directly in the `toTheme` method, will be moved into the `FlexSubThemes` class
as well in a future update.

You can also the static sub-themes without even using
FlexColorScheme based theming. The `FlexSubThemesData` configuration has
no direct impact on these static helpers. It is `FlexColorScheme` that uses
the `FlexSubThemesData` class to configure the opt-in sub-themes based on
the setup information provided via `FlexColorScheme.subThemesData`.

These component themes are available:

* `ButtonThemeData` for old deprecated buttons, via `buttonTheme`.
* `BottomNavigationBarThemeData` for `BottomNavigationBar` via
  `bottomNavigationBar`.
* `BottomSheetThemeData` for `BottomSheet` via `bottomSheetTheme`.
* `CardTheme` for `Card` via `cardTheme`.
* `CheckboxThemeData` for `Checkbox` via `checkboxTheme`.
* `ChipThemeData` for `Chip` via `chipTheme`.
* `DialogTheme` for `Dialog` via `dialogTheme`.
* `ElevatedButtonThemeData` for `ElevatedButton` via `elevatedButtonTheme`.
* `FloatingActionButtonThemeData` for `FloatingActionButton` via
  `floatingActionButtonTheme`.
* `InputDecorationTheme` for `InputDecoration` via `inputDecorationTheme`.
* `NavigationBarThemeData` for `NavigationBar` via `navigationBarTheme`.
* `NavigationRailThemeData` for `NavigationRail` via `navigationRailTheme`.
* `OutlinedButtonThemeData` for `OutlinedButton` via `outlinedButtonTheme`.
* `PopupMenuThemeData` for `PopupMenuButton` via `popupMenuTheme`.
* `RadioThemeData` for `Radio` via `radioTheme`.
* `SnackBarThemeData` for `SnackBar` via `snackBarTheme`.
* `SwitchThemeData` for `Switch` via `switchTheme`.
* `TextButtonThemeData` for `TextButton` via `textButtonTheme`.
* `TimePickerThemeData` for `TimePickerDialog` via `timePickerTheme`.
* `ToggleButtonsThemeData` for `ToggleButtons` via `toggleButtonsTheme`.

In `ToggleButtons` hover, press, selected and focus states are not
an exact match for the main buttons. It does not have as flexible styling
as the main buttons. The theme mimics the style of the `OutlinedButton` for
not selected buttons and the style of `ElevatedButton` for selected
button. It does not support `MaterialStateProperty` and has only
one state for different parts of the button. The selected and not selected,
states would need different property values to be able to match the general
buttons. It can therefore not fully match the same theme style as the
Material states used on two different `ButtonStyleButton` buttons that
it should match.

The theme `ButtonThemeData` is included to provide a very similar
theme style on the deprecated legacy buttons `RaisedButton`,
`OutlineButton` and `FlatButton` as on the current main buttons. It is not
an exact match, since the legacy buttons do not offer as flexible
styling as the newer buttons. They do follow and match the styling on
`ToggleButtons` when it comes to hover, press, selected and focus.
Please consider phasing out the legacy buttons, as they are deprecated and
will be removed from the Flutter SDK in next stable release. Their theme
the `ButtonThemeData` will also soon be deprecated and later removed.

The following widgets have rounded corners, but are excluded from the
component theming for now:

* `Tooltip`, generally so small that larger prominent rounding the
  opinionated sub-theming is designed for, is not a good fit.
  FlexColorScheme does include out of the box theming options for tooltips,
  that also adapts to color branding when opting in on sub themes,
  it also gets a bit more rounded when opting in.
* `Scrollbar`, rounding on edges of scrollbars are left to platform default.
* The `AppBar` and `BottomAppBar` shape properties are left to their defaults.
* `SnackBar` the floating SnackBar should be themed to also include
  border radius, but the none floating one should remain
  straight. This cannot can be done via current theming features.
* `Drawer` should have have rounding on shown side edge, it is in recent
  version (2.8.0) possible to assign a Shape in the drawer theme. But
  Drawer uses same theme, when used as Drawer and EndDrawer and the rounding
  should be on end edge on Drawer and start edge in EndDrawer. It seem we
  cannot do   this without having two Shapes in its theme or other usage
  behavior modifying it. A default behavior in SDK can implement it by looking up
  if Drawer is being used in Scaffold as Drawer or EndDrawer, but support
  via theme is needed too.

You can find more information about available component theme
helpers in the [API docs](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemes-class.html).
You could as mentioned also use these static sub-theme helpers to manually
define widget sub-theme and further modify them using `copyWith`.
