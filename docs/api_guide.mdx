# API Guide

**TODO: Review and update chapter to version 5, with revised structure.**

The API reference documentation for FlexColorScheme is very thorough and complete.
It usually covers any question you might have, and more. The automatically
generated API docs from source code document comments are available
[here](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/flex_color_scheme-library.html).

A brief overview of key APIs is presented below. This readme file is reaching
the character limit of 128kB, which is the maximum size pub.dev allows, if the
readme is larger it rejects the packages.

To make the documentation more accessible and easier to read, and to
also make it possible to extend it further and update it without publishing
a new package version, this readme will later be migrated to use
a markup generated documentation site. It will be based on
[docs.page](https://docs.page/homepage). When that is done, this chapter can
be further extended with more examples and screenshots.

## Main Setup

You can create FlexColorScheme based `ThemeData` objects using two
different ways. Using the `FlexColorScheme` class or the `FlexThemeData`
extension.

### FlexColorScheme

API reference: [FlexColorScheme](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexColorScheme-class.html)

The original way to create FlexColorScheme based `ThemeData` objects is to use
the package namesake
[`FlexColorScheme`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexColorScheme-class.html)
class and then use the `toTheme` getter to produce and get the `ThemeData`
object specified by your immutable `FlexColorScheme` configuration.

Typically, you would not use the default `FlexColorScheme()` constructor to
create your `FlexColorScheme` object. Instead, you would use
[`FlexColorScheme.light()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexColorScheme/FlexColorScheme.light.html)
and
[`FlexColorScheme.dark()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexColorScheme/FlexColorScheme.dark.html) factory
constructors to make definitions for light and dark theme modes. The
factory constructors also offer many additional parameters that give you
the capability to easily create more nuanced color schemes definitions.

**Example:**
```dart
  class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      // The Mandy red, light theme.
      theme: FlexColorScheme.light(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed).toTheme,
      // The Mandy red, dark theme.
      darkTheme: FlexColorScheme.dark(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed).toTheme,
      // Use dark or light theme based on system setting.
      themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
```

### FlexThemeData extension on ThemeData

API reference: [FlexThemeData](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexThemeData.html)

The `FlexThemeData` is a convenience extension on `ThemeData` to define a
`FlexColorScheme` object and return the `ThemeData` object defined by
its instance, using its `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` method in one go.

Provided `ThemeData` convenience static extension functions are:

* [`FlexThemeData.light()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexThemeData/light.html) based on `FlexColorScheme.light().toTheme`
* [`FlexThemeData.dark()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexThemeData/dark.html) based on `FlexColorScheme.dark().toTheme`

Using e.g. `FlexThemeData.light()` is a bit shorter than
`FlexColorScheme.light().toTheme`, and it may feel more familiar since
you get a `ThemeData` object directly that you can use just like any
other `ThemeData` object produced by Flutter SDK built in `ThemeData` factory
constructors.

**Example:**
```dart
  class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      // The Mandy red, light theme.
      theme: FlexThemeData.light(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed),
      // The Mandy red, dark theme.
      darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(scheme: FlexScheme.mandyRed),
      // Use dark or light theme based on system setting.
      themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
```

The `FlexColorScheme.light().toTheme` and `FlexThemedata.light()` and its dark
counterparts, have the same parameter value and are interchangeable.
The `light` and `dark` parameters differ slightly due to a few different features.

### Main setup parameters

Key setup parameters for `FlexColorScheme.light()` and
`FlexThemedata.light()` as well as for `FlexColorScheme.dark()` and
`FlexThemedata.dark()` are listed below. The two most important ones are:

* `scheme` a [`FlexScheme`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexScheme.html)
  enum value used to select which predefined color scheme to use for the theme.
* `colors` a [`FlexSchemeColor`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSchemeColor-class.html)
  object used to define custom colors to be used to create the theme.

If you specify both `scheme` and `colors` the custom colors have higher precedence
and are used, the `scheme` property is ignored. If you specify neither, then
`scheme` defaults to `FlexScheme.material`.

Starting from version 4.2.0 you also have the possibility of creating your custom
`FlexColorScheme` based theme from a Flutter SDK standard `ColorScheme` object.
Use the property:

* `colorScheme` a
  [`ColorScheme`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ColorScheme-class.html)
  object used to create a custom `FlexColorScheme` based theme from custom color
  definitions you may have in a standard color scheme
  object. This property also exist in the default constructor. When you use it
  with the factory constructors `light` and `dark` the colors in the provided
  `colorScheme` will override any value you have given in the `scheme` or `colors`
  properties. The individual direct color properties available in the constructors,
  will override any corresponding color values that would be set via other
  properties, also the ones you in your `colorScheme` if it is provided.

FlexColorScheme has shortcut enum properties that you can use to quickly adjust
the theme design for your AppBar and TabBar:

* `appBarStyle`
  a [`FlexAppBarStyle`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexAppBarStyle.html)
  enum value used to define the themed color of the AppBar background color.
* [`tabBarStyle`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexColorScheme/tabBarStyle.html)
  a [`FlexTabBarStyle`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexTabBarStyle.html)
  enum value used to select preferred style for the default TabBarTheme sub-theme.

An interesting and unique feature of FlexColorScheme is its capability to
automatically create color schemes and resulting themes that blend in the primary
color into different surfaces. You can also vary this blending depending
on surface type and use different blend strengths. This feature is only available
via the factory constructors and their `ThemeData`extensions, not via the
default `FlexColorscheme` constructor. To use the surface blending features use
the properties:

* `surfaceMode` a [`FlexSurfaceMode`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSurfaceMode.html)
  enum value used to select the mode for blending in primary color into
  surface, background, scaffoldBackground and dialogBackground colors.
* `blendLevel`, when `surfaceMode` is defined, this sets the blend level strength
   used by the selected surface mode.
   The blend level is the integer decimal value of the alpha value
   used in the alpha blend function. It mixes one color with another
   by using alpha opacity value in the color of a surface put on top of
   another surface with opaque color and returns the result as one opaque
   color.

FlexColorScheme also offers opinionated widget sub-theming that enables you to get
more snazzy looking widgets automatically that you can customize further via
[FlexSubThemesData](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemesData-class.html).

* [`useSubTheme`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexColorScheme/useSubThemes.html)
  when `true` activates the opinionated sub theming, it is `false` by default.
* `subThemesData` is a
  [`FlexSubThemesData`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemesData-class.html)
  data class that contain many optional quick configuration parameters
  for the opt-in widget sub-themes. For example, one of its parameters gives you
  access to easy use customization of default border radius on all Flutter SDK
  UI widgets and elements that supports border radius, either via
  ShapeBorder or BorderRadiusGeometry. See its
  [`defaultRadius`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemesData/defaultRadius.html)
  property for more information.

When you opt in on using sub-themes, the `FlexColorScheme.toTheme` method uses
the passed in `FlexSubThemesData` configuration data object, passed in via
`FlexColorScheme.subThemesData`, or a default one if one is not provided.

The property values in `FlexSubThemesData` are used to define the created
opinionated sub-themes. In some simple cases the sub-themes are created
directly with the Flutter SDK widget sub-theme in question, in the `toTheme`
method. But in most cases it uses separate static sub-theme helper functions
from the `FlexSubThemes` class. You can find more information about available
helpers
[here](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexSubThemes-class.html).
You can also use these static sub-theme helpers to manually define widget
sub-theme and even modify them using `copyWith`.
