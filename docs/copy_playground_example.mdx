# Copy Playground Theme

**TODO: Add guide on how to use Copy Playground Theme App V5**

There is also a simple template example suitable for testing themes that you
copy-paste from the **Themes Playground** example. It is intended to be used
as a quick and simple app that you can use for experimenting with pasted in
themes generated by the live web application. Its source code is available in
the example sub folder in folder
[/example_copy_paste](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example_copy_paste).
