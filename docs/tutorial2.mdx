# 2) Custom Theme

This example shows how you can define your own color schemes using
`FlexSchemeColor` and `FlexSchemeData`, to create `FlexColorScheme` based
application themes from them.

Only code highlights might be shown below, the complete code for the example is
[here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example2).


## Skeleton Template

In this example, and the ones after it, we use a `ThemeService` and
`ThemeController` to manage our theme settings. This follows the example
architecture you get when you create a Flutter template application
architecture with:

```bash
 > flutter create -t skeleton my_flutter_app
```

## ThemeServiceMem

This example uses a theme service with only memory storage and no persistence.
In later examples we will use locally persisting theme services.

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // The used memory only theme service.
  final ThemeService themeService = ThemeServiceMem();
  // Initialize the theme service.
  await themeService.init();
  // Create a ThemeController that uses the ThemeService.
  final ThemeController themeController = ThemeController(themeService);
  // Load preferred theme settings, while the app is loading, before MaterialApp
  // is created, this prevents a theme change when the app is first displayed.
  await themeController.loadAll();
  // Run the app and pass in the ThemeController. The app listens to the
  // ThemeController for changes.
  runApp(DemoApp(themeController: themeController));
}
```

In this example we use the theme controller to change the `themeMode` and to
toggle opting in and out of FlexColorScheme's opinionated component sub-themes.

## Custom Colors

To make a custom color scheme, we for simplicity define it as a local
constant in this example. We make a `FlexSchemeData` object with a name,
description and `FlexSchemeColor` colors defined for light and
matching dark scheme.

```dart
const FlexSchemeData _myFlexScheme = FlexSchemeData(
  name: 'Midnight blue',
  description: 'Midnight blue theme, custom definition of all colors',
  light: FlexSchemeColor(
    primary: Color(0xFF00296B),
    primaryContainer: Color(0xFFA0C2ED),
    secondary: Color(0xFFD26900),
    secondaryContainer: Color(0xFFFFD270),
    tertiary: Color(0xFF5C5C95),
    tertiaryContainer: Color(0xFFC8DBF8),
  ),
  dark: FlexSchemeColor(
    primary: Color(0xFFB1CFF5),
    primaryContainer: Color(0xFF3873BA),
    secondary: Color(0xFFFFD270),
    secondaryContainer: Color(0xFFD26900),
    tertiary: Color(0xFFC9CBFC),
    tertiaryContainer: Color(0xFF535393),
  ),
);
```

We could also have stored the light and dark scheme only in their own
`FlexSchemeColor` objects, and added them directly in their respective
`colors` property in `FlexThemeData.light` and `FlexThemeData.dark`.
However, we will also use this information on the `HomePage` for the
theme switch widget and to display the scheme name and description.
Putting them in a `FlexSchemeData` object that bundles the light and
dark scheme color `FlexSchemeColor`, plus a name and description, is a
convenient way to pass it along and re-use the information on the home page.

We use the `FlexSchemeData` instance `_myFlexScheme` instance `light` and `dark`
properties, as `colors` value for our `FlexThemeData.light` and
`FlexThemeData.dark`, that we then assign to the `MaterialApp` light theme
property `theme` and `darkTheme` property respectively.

The setup is similar to how we used one of the built-in predefined
`FlexSchemeData` objects in example 1 via its enum selection property,
but in this case we defined our own custom `FlexSchemeData` in `_myFlexScheme`
and used the `colors` property in `FlexSchemeData` to tell it to use those
colors instead of a built-in scheme.

## Theme Setup

Based on the Flutter Skeleton template architecture we glue the `ThemeController`
to the MaterialApp. The Flutter standard `AnimatedBuilder` Widget listens to
the `ThemeController` for changes.

The Flutter `AnimatedBuilder` is a bit oddly named for this use case. Here
it serves the purpose of functioning as kind of a "`ValueListenableBuilder`",
that rebuilds its child when its `Listenable` value, the `animation` changes.
Which it does whenever our `ThemeController` calls `notifyListeners`, when
we update any of its properties. Which we do in the `ThemeController` class
when we have new updated data that requires the theme to update. The
`ThemeController` values are typically changed by user interface widgets on the
`HomePage`.

> The usage of the `AnimatedBuilder` does not have anything to do with the
> fact that the theme changes animate from current ThemeData and colors in it,
> to the new ones it changes to. This is a built-in feature in ThemeData and
> its inherited Theme in Flutter SDK. You can change the `ThemeData` with
> call-backs or other state management solutions too, and still get the
> nice theme change animation.
>
> The `AnimatedBuilder` is a poor name when it is used as a

The result of this setup is that whenever you update any theme settings managed by
the `ThemeController`, the `MaterialApp` is rebuilt with the new ThemeData that
depends on the `ThemeController`'s property values. In fact the entire app UI
is rebuilt when any value in the `ThemeController` trigger a change via a
`notifyListeners` call. This is fine in this case, since all properties in it are
of the nature that the entire application UI needs to be redrawn anyway when they
change, since they modify our `ThemeData` for the entire application.
Thus this approach works well for this particular use case.

```dart
class DemoApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const DemoApp({Key? key, required this.themeController}) : super(key: key);
  final ThemeController themeController;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Glue the ThemeController to the MaterialApp.
    return AnimatedBuilder(
        animation: themeController,
        builder: (BuildContext context, Widget? child) {
          return MaterialApp(
            debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
            scrollBehavior: const AppScrollBehavior(),
            title: 'Custom Theme',
            theme: FlexThemeData.light(
              colors: _myFlexScheme.light,
              // Opt in/out on using FlexColorScheme sub-themes.
              subThemesData: themeController.useSubThemes
                  ? const FlexSubThemesData()
                  : null,
              appBarElevation: 0.5,
              visualDensity: VisualDensity.standard,
              fontFamily: GoogleFonts.notoSans().fontFamily,
            ),
            // Same setup for the dark theme, but using FlexThemeData.dark().
            darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
              colors: _myFlexScheme.dark,
              subThemesData: themeController.useSubThemes
                  ? const FlexSubThemesData()
                  : null,
              appBarElevation: 1,
              visualDensity: VisualDensity.standard,
              fontFamily: GoogleFonts.notoSans().fontFamily,
            ),
            themeMode: themeController.themeMode,
            home: HomePage(
              flexSchemeData: _myFlexScheme,
              // Pass in the theme controller to the home page.
              controller: themeController,
            ),
          );
        });
  }
}
```

## Component Themes

In this example above, we also use a boolean theme controller setting used as toggle
to decide if we opt in our out of using the FlexColorScheme opinionated
component sub-themes. When the opt-in is true we pass in a default
`FlexSubThemesData()` constructor, otherwise `null` to not use the
sub themes at all. Later we will explore more options that we can configure with
`FlexSubThemesData`

```dart
  // Opt in/out on using FlexColorScheme sub-themes.
  subThemesData: themeController.useSubThemes
      ? const FlexSubThemesData()
      : null,
```

## Google Fonts

We also added a custom font by assigning one to `fontFamily` from by using
`GoogleFonts.notoSans().fontFamily`. The Noto Sans font is nice alternative
to the default `Roboto`font. For better and more fine controlled results over
your custom `TextTheme`, prefer defining complete `TextThemes,` using a font
and its different styles. You can then use more than one font for your text theme.
Then assign the `TextTheme` to the `textTheme` and `primaryTextTheme`
properties in `FlexThemeData`. Both options work how you would use do it
with standard `ThemeData` too.

The `themeController` is also passed to the `HomePage` where we use it in UI
widgets to change the theme mode, and to opt in and out of using the sub themes
feature in FlexColorScheme.

## Result

When we build this application we can see our custom colors being used
on all widget. We also notice that the widget components look a lot different
compared to example 1. This is because we enabled using the FlexColorScheme
opinionated widget sub themes, by default when we used the `themeController.useSubThemes` value.

 We can compare the difference between using the FlexColorScheme opinionated widget
 component sub themes  and just default widget theming, by toggling the switch for it.
 The default settings for opinionated component themes use rounded corners on widgets that
 default to the [Material 3 design guide](https://m3.material.io/) specified values.
 The border radius varies per widget type. In the Material 2 design it is 4 dp on
 most widget. Later we will se how can more easily customize the border radius.
