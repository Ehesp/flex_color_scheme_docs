# 2. Custom Theme

This example shows how you can define your own color schemes using `FlexSchemeColor` and `FlexSchemeData`, to create `FlexColorScheme` based application themes from them.

Only code highlights might be shown below. The complete code of this example can be found [here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example2_custom_theme).

## Skeleton Template

In this example, and the ones after it, we use a `ThemeService` and `ThemeController` to manage our theme settings. This follows the example architecture you get when you create a Flutter template application architecture with:

```bash
 > flutter create -t skeleton my_flutter_app
```

You can find a good article on GSkinner site blogs, doing a deep dive into the Flutter skeleton template architecture [here](https://blog.gskinner.com/archives/2021/11/flutter-deep-dive-into-the-new-skeleton-app-template.html).

These examples do not use all parts of the skeleton architecture, only the theme service part and using the `ListenableBuilder` as a listenable builder.

## ThemeServiceMem

This example uses a theme service with only memory storage and no persistence. In later examples, we will use locally persisting theme services.

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // The used memory only theme service.
  final ThemeService themeService = ThemeServiceMem();
  // Initialize the theme service.
  await themeService.init();
  // Create a ThemeController that uses the ThemeService.
  final ThemeController themeController = ThemeController(themeService);
  // Load preferred theme settings, while the app is loading, before MaterialApp
  // is created, this prevents a theme change when the app is first displayed.
  await themeController.loadAll();
  // Run the app and pass in the ThemeController. The app listens to the
  // ThemeController for changes.
  runApp(DemoApp(themeController: themeController));
}
```

Above we use the theme controller to change the `themeMode` and to toggle opting in and out of using FlexColorScheme's opinionated component sub-themes.

## Custom Colors

To make a custom color scheme, we for simplicity define it as a local constant in this example. We make a `FlexSchemeData` object with a name, description and all required `FlexSchemeColor` colors defined for light and matching dark schemes.

```dart
const FlexSchemeData _myFlexScheme = FlexSchemeData(
  name: 'Midnight blue',
  description: 'Midnight blue theme, custom definition of all colors',
  light: FlexSchemeColor(
    primary: Color(0xFF00296B),
    primaryContainer: Color(0xFFA0C2ED),
    secondary: Color(0xFFD26900),
    secondaryContainer: Color(0xFFFFD270),
    tertiary: Color(0xFF5C5C95),
    tertiaryContainer: Color(0xFFC8DBF8),
  ),
  dark: FlexSchemeColor(
    primary: Color(0xFFB1CFF5),
    primaryContainer: Color(0xFF3873BA),
    secondary: Color(0xFFFFD270),
    secondaryContainer: Color(0xFFD26900),
    tertiary: Color(0xFFC9CBFC),
    tertiaryContainer: Color(0xFF535393),
  ),
);
```

We could also have stored the light and dark scheme only in their own `FlexSchemeColor` objects, and added them directly in their respective `colors` property in `FlexThemeData.light` and `FlexThemeData.dark`. However, we will also use this information on the `HomePage` for the theme switch widget and to display the scheme name and description. Putting them in a `FlexSchemeData` object that bundles the light and dark scheme color `FlexSchemeColor`, plus a name and description, is a convenient way to pass it along and re-use the information on the `HomePage`.

We use the `FlexSchemeData` instance `_myFlexScheme` instance `light` and `dark` properties, as the `colors` value for our `FlexThemeData.light` and `FlexThemeData.dark`, that we then assign to the `MaterialApp` light theme property `theme` and `darkTheme` property respectively.

The setup is similar to how we used one of the built-in predefined `FlexSchemeData` objects in example 1 via its enum selection property, but in this case we defined our own custom `FlexSchemeData` in `_myFlexScheme` and used the `colors` property in `FlexSchemeData` to tell it to use those colors instead of a built-in scheme.

## Theme Setup

Based on the Flutter Skeleton template architecture we glue the `ThemeController` to the MaterialApp. The Flutter standard `AnimatedBuilder` Widget listens to the `ThemeController` for changes.

The Flutter `AnimatedBuilder` is a bit oddly named for this use case. Here it serves the purpose of functioning as a "`ListenableBuilder`", that rebuilds its child once, when its `Listenable` value, the `animation` changes. Which it does whenever our `ThemeController` calls `notifyListeners`, when we update any of its properties. We call `notifyListeners` in the `ThemeController` class when we have new updated data that requires the theme to update. The `ThemeController` values are typically changed by user interface widgets on the `HomePage`.

## ListenableBuilder or AnimatedBuilder

Previously the skeleton architecture used the `AnimatedBuilder`, so did these tutorial apps. The usage of the `AnimatedBuilder` did not have anything to do with the fact that the theme change animates from current `ThemeData` and colors in it, to the new values and colors it changes to. This is a built-in feature in `ThemeData` and its inherited `Theme` in Flutter SDK. You can change the `ThemeData` with call-backs or other state management solutions too, and still get the nice theme change lerp animation from previous property values to new ones.

The `AnimatedBuilder` was a poor name when used here as a `ListenableBuilder`, but it did not use to exist in Flutter SDK with that name. Flutter 3.10 brought same functionality as the `AnimatedBuilder`, but with the `ListenableBuilder` name, making it easier to discover the feature. The [`ListenableBuilder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListenableBuilder-class.html) was added via [PR #116543](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/116543).

The result of this `ListenableBuilder` setup is that whenever you update any theme settings managed by the `ThemeController`, the `MaterialApp` is rebuilt with the new ThemeData that depends on the `ThemeController`'s property values.

The entire application tree is actually rebuilt when any value in the `ThemeController` trigger a change via a `notifyListeners` call. This is reasonably fine in this use case, since all properties we use in the `ThemeController` are of the nature that the entire application UI needs to be redrawn anyway when they change, since they modify our `ThemeData` for the entire application.

This approach works well for this particular use case, but may not work as well for some use cases as it is a bit suboptimal to always rebuild the entire subtree whenever anything bound to the same `ChangeNotifier` controller changes. You could of course use the same idea to add more/other controllers and in `StatefulWidget`s at right levels in the widget tree use e.g. `otherController.addListener(() => setState((){}))`. Then you do not need an `ListenableBuilder` and you get a basic MVC like state management, where you bind a `ChangeNotifier` to the tree and trigger rebuilds in a simple way.

## Theming Code

This was a lot of explanations, no need to worry about most it for your theme
definition, as shown below, it is simple.

```dart
class DemoApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const DemoApp({Key? key, required this.themeController}) : super(key: key);
  final ThemeController themeController;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Whenever the theme controller notifies the listener in the
    // ListenableBuilder, the MaterialApp is rebuilt.
    return ListenableBuilder(
        listenable: themeController,
        builder: (BuildContext context, Widget? child) {
          return MaterialApp(
            debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
            scrollBehavior: const AppScrollBehavior(),
            title: 'Custom Theme',
            theme: FlexThemeData.light(
              useMaterial3: themeController.useMaterial3,
              colors: _myFlexScheme.light,
              // Opt in/out on using FlexColorScheme sub-themes.
              subThemesData: themeController.useSubThemes
                  ? const FlexSubThemesData()
                  : null,
              appBarElevation: 0.5,
              visualDensity: VisualDensity.standard,
              fontFamily: GoogleFonts.notoSans().fontFamily,
              // We use the nicer Material-3 Typography in both M2 and M3 mode.
              typography: Typography.material2021(platform: defaultTargetPlatform),
            ),
            // Same setup for the dark theme, but using FlexThemeData.dark().
            darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
              useMaterial3: themeController.useMaterial3,
              colors: _myFlexScheme.dark,
              subThemesData: themeController.useSubThemes
                  ? const FlexSubThemesData()
                  : null,
              appBarElevation: 1,
              visualDensity: VisualDensity.standard,
              fontFamily: GoogleFonts.notoSans().fontFamily,
              typography: Typography.material2021(platform: defaultTargetPlatform),
            ),
            themeMode: themeController.themeMode,
            home: HomePage(
              flexSchemeData: _myFlexScheme,
              // Pass in the theme controller to the home page.
              controller: themeController,
            ),
          );
        });
  }
}
```

## Component Themes

In this example above, we also use a boolean theme controller setting used as toggle to decide if we opt in our out of using FlexColorScheme opinionated component sub-themes. When the opt-in is true via `themeController.useSubThemes` we pass in a default `FlexSubThemesData()` constructor, otherwise `null`, to not use the sub-themes at all. Later we will explore sub-theme options that we can configure with `FlexSubThemesData()`.

```dart
  // Opt in/out on using FlexColorScheme sub-themes.
  subThemesData: themeController.useSubThemes
      ? const FlexSubThemesData()
      : null,
```

## Google Fonts

We also added a custom font by assigning one to `fontFamily` from Google fonts by using `GoogleFonts.notoSans().fontFamily`. The Noto Sans font is a nice alternative to the default Roboto font.

For better and more fine controlled results over your custom `TextTheme`, prefer defining complete `TextThemes,` using a font and its different styles. You can then use more than one font for your text theme. Then assign the `TextTheme` to the `textTheme` and `primaryTextTheme` properties in `FlexThemeData`. Both options work just as you would use them with `ThemeData`.

The `themeController` is also passed to the `HomePage` where we use it in UI widgets to change the theme mode, and to opt in and out of using the opinionated component theming features also offered by FlexColorScheme.

## Result

When we build this example, we can see our custom colors being used on all widgets. We also notice that the widget components look a lot different compared to example 1. This is because we enabled using the FlexColorScheme opinionated component sub-themes by default when we used the `themeController.useSubThemes` value.

  </tr>
 </table>

 We can compare the difference between using the FlexColorScheme opinionated component sub-themes and just default widget theming by toggling the switch for it.

 The settings for opinionated component themes in Material-2 mode, use rounded corners on widgets that default to the [Material-3 design guide](https://m3.material.io/) specified values. In Material-3 design, the border radius varies per widget type. In the Flutter's current Material-2 design defaults, it is 4 dp on almost all widgets, this per the Material-2 design specification. Later we will see how we can easily customize the border radius on all components, as well as by component.

If we keep Material-2 mode OFF and also turn OFF using the FlexColorScheme Material-2 mode component theming, we can see that the Flutter Material-2 defaults look very different. The FlexColorScheme Material-2 mode component themes are on purposed very opinionated, they draw inspiration from Material-3, but made in Material-2 mode, as far as that is possible in Flutter.
