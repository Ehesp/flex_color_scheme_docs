# Changelog

The migration guide only contained topics that you must address in order
to migrate from a lower major version, to the next higher version,
for it to work at all.

The changelog contains details and information about possible minor style changes,
and lists all new features and fix in all major, minor and fix releases.

For a detailed changelog, please refer to the latest published package
[changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/changelog),
it is quite detailed.


## What is new in Version 5?

**TODO: Add summary info on what is new in version**

### New Color Schemes

There are of course new built-in color schemes. Four of them is the de-facto
norm for major new releases. The new color schemes in version 5 are:

* **Flutter Dash** - A blu Flutter Dash wallpaper based theme
* **M3 baseline** - Material guide 3 baseline based theme
* **Verdun green** - Material guide 3 verdun and mineral green with hemlock
* **Dell genoa green** - Material guide 3 theme with dell, axolotl and genoa greens


## What is New in Version 4?

For a detailed list of what is new in version 4, please refer to the
[change log](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme/changelog).

There are two major new features. The first one is that FlexColorScheme
now comes with **opinionated widget sub themes** that you can opt in on.
By default, these Flutter UI widget sub themes follow the
[Material 3 guide](https://m3.material.io/). This is done
as far as reasonably possible while still using standard Material 2 theming features
available in Flutter 2.8. There is a Material 3 style TextTheme as well, and by
default this text theme is also slightly color tinted using the color
scheme's primary color. You can turn these styles on and off, based on your
your own preferences when you opt in on the sub themes.

The second main new feature is that FlexColorScheme now offers **9 different surface
color blend modes**, with **40 different blend levels** each. Version 3 only had one
"blend style" with 5 levels, including the no blend option.
The version 3 blend style API is still available and works, but is deprecated
since version 4.2.0. Despite the major version bump from 3 to 4, all APIs from
version 3 are fully compatible with version 4. The version was mostly bumped
because it contains so many new features that it made sense.

### New Color Schemes

There are of course new built-in color schemes. Four of them seems to
be the standard for major new releases. The new color schemes are:

* **Blue whale** - Blue whale, jungle green and outrageous tango orange
* **San Juan** - San Juan blue and pink salmon theme
* **Rosewood** - Rosewood red, with horses neck and driftwood theme
* **Blumine** - Blumine, easter blue and saffron mango theme

Total number of offered built-in color schemes is now **36 matched light
and dark pairs**. By using the swap primary and secondary colors, you can double
the amount of variations with just a boolean toggle. Not all the color
schemes are so attractive when you swap the colors, but some were designed to
support it and look well with the colors reversed too. You can for example use
this to present the dark mode with primary and secondary colors swapped
compared to the light mode.
