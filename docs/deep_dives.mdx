# Deep Dives

This chapters provides deeper and more detailed information and explanations
on included topics. It will receive updates and new deep dives as needed
in future updates based on questions user of **FlexColorScheme** have.

This chapter may contain images and animations from older versions
of **FlexColorScheme**. They are used when the principles presented are still
the same and the actual images matter less. Future version of this chapter
may update the images to current version of FlexColorScheme, if it is
needed to improve the explanations.

## Visual Density

Examples 3,4 and 5 in this package use **comfortable** adaptive platform visual
density via `FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity`, instead of the
default counter application's `VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity`.

This is an alternative visual density design that on desktop applications
results in the Flutter `comfortable` visual density being used, instead of
`compact`. On devices, they both result in the default large `standard`
visual density that is suitable for small touch devices.

This helper function was added to provide an easy option for using a bit larger
UI elements on desktop and web apps, while keeping the correct size for devices.

If the desktop and web versions of the app is used on computers with touch
screens, the `comfortable` density provides a nice balance. It still looks
compact enough to be desktop like, while providing a bit more touch friendly
space, without looking like an overblown small device UI on a desktop.

FlexColorScheme can also use the `VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity` value.
If you prefer it, just replace the line with it. If you do not specify any
visual density, the Flutter default density `standard` is used on
**all platforms**. This creates widgets with a lot of white space around and
inside them. It may not be what you want on web/desktop applications, but is
the correct choice for small touch devices. The visual density feature in
Flutter was created to address this difference in design requirement.

The Flutter SDK built-in function `VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity`
was added to adapt the density according to used platform. The
`FlexColorScheme.comfortablePlatformDensity` does the same, but with a bit
more white space on desktops.  Use the one you like and works best for
your use case.

## FlexThemeModeSwitch

One feature on the `HomePage` of examples 1 to 4 is the `FlexThemeModeSwitch`.
It is the UI Widget used for the 3-way theme mode switch used in these
examples to change the active theme mode.

<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/theme_mode_switch.png?raw=true" alt="theme mode switch" width="350"/>

Using the switch is simple, give it the currently selected and active theme
mode, the current `FlexSchemeData` scheme, so it can color its buttons correctly.
Then use the `onThemeModeChanged` callback for changes to its mode, and change
the `themeMode` property in the `MaterialApp` accordingly, to actually change
the used theme mode.

```dart
FlexThemeModeSwitch(
  themeMode: themeMode,
  onThemeModeChanged: onThemeModeChanged,
  flexSchemeData: flexSchemeData,
),
```

Using the `FlexThemeModeSwitch` 3-way theme mode switch is optional and not
required to use `FlexColorScheme` based themes. It is just a custom theme mode
switch design and was included as a bonus feature in the
`FlexColorScheme` package. It was added based on a request after it
had been observed in the wild in the Flexfold demo app.

In the Flexfold demo app the switch was originally a fairly fixed design.
This `FlexThemeModeSwitch` has many properties that allow you to customize
it extensively. You can find its [API
reference here](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexThemeModeSwitch-class.html) and its companion, the
`FlexThemeModeOptionButton` [API reference here](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexThemeModeOptionButton-class.html).
With the API you can customize the look of the `FlexThemeModeSwitch`,
here are some examples:

<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/ThemeSwitchCustomize.png?raw=true" alt="theme mode customize"/>

The `FlexThemeModeOptionButton` is typically used by the `FlexThemeModeSwitch`,
but it can also be used as a part of other theme related indicator widgets.
Like for example the scrolling horizontal list used in example 5, where it is
used as a theme indicator and selector in a horizontally scrolling list.

<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/ThemeIndicatorList.png?raw=true" alt="theme indicator list"/>

## Computed Dark Theme

Example 5 allows us to toggle the dark mode, from using its hand tuned
predefined dark scheme colors, to the dark scheme colors computed from the
light scheme colors. Let's use it to compare some examples.

When using the **Deep blue sea** scheme, the computed dark theme colors ones
are a bit more dull and muted in this example, the computed dark scheme
is on the right.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/fcs_phone_ex5ad.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5 dark" width="250"/>](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/fcs_phone_ex5ad.png?raw=true)</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/fcs_phone_ex5ad-to-black.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5 dark computed" width="250"/>](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/fcs_phone_ex5ad-to-black.png?raw=true)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">_Designed dark **Deep blue see** theme (left) versus computed dark theme (right) from its light theme._</td>
  </tr>
</table>

With some other color schemes, like the **Aqua blue** one, there is only a
minor difference, the computed dark scheme is on the right.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/fcs_phone_ex5a2d.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5a2 dark" width="250"/>](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/fcs_phone_ex5a2d.png?raw=true)</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/fcs_phone_ex5a2d-to-black.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5 dark computed" width="250"/>](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/fcs_phone_ex5a2d-to-black.png?raw=true)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">_Designed dark **Aqua blue** theme (left) versus computed dark theme (right) from its light theme._</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The result of the `toDark` method varies depending on how saturated the used
light scheme colors are. It is possible to tune the calculated dark scheme by
modifying the `whiteBlend` property it uses to blend in white to make the
dark scheme. The default `whiteBlend` is 35%, this is normally a suitable
value. For more saturated light scheme colors try 40%, which is also used in
the Material 2 design guide to convert the default red error color for light
mode, to dark mode. For light scheme color with low saturation, a white
blend of 20...30% often produces nice results.

With the included level slider in the example 5 we can interactively change
the `whiteBlend` level for the computed dark mode scheme colors. Let's select
a color scheme, say the **Brand blues** one, then go dark.

By default, the built-in predefined hand-picked matching dark scheme colors
for the dark theme mode are used. Turn on the "Compute dark theme" mode,
the result is pretty close to the predefined one for this dark scheme with
the default level of 35%. Then adjust the white level blend to tune how
saturated the computed dark scheme colors are compared to their light scheme
master. At 0% they are the same as the light scheme, at 100%, well then they
are white, not so useful. A range of 10...50% can produce excellent results.
What is best depends on how saturated your starting light scheme colors are,
and of course what kind of matching dark theme look you like and want.

If you use the even darker dark-mode, **true black**, you may want to have a
different saturation for your dark scheme colors compared to standard
dark-mode surface. You could easily implement that adjustment with this feature.

This screen recording compares the computed `toDark` theme result, to the
built-in hand-picked one. It does this by toggling the mode a few times, so
you can compare the different results. It also uses the level slider
to adjust the `toDark` theme result. A sharp eye might notice that this
recording does not use the `defaultError` error color modifier, the changing
dark error color does not look so nice when tuning the computed scheme colors.
The bundled example 5 and live web version of it uses the modifier.

<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets/fcs_v1-1-0-phone1.gif?raw=true" alt="Dark scheme calc level"/>


So that you can find the same setup in the new version 5 of the ThemesPlayground,
here is an image of it when using the same `brandBlue` scheme
and computing the dark theme from light one at level 35%. You can see the code
in the image too, the key part is this:

```dart
darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
  colors: FlexColor.schemes[FlexScheme.brandBlue]!
      .light.defaultError.toDark(35, false),
```

[<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-deep-01-toDark.png?raw=true" alt="V5 toDark-1"/>](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-deep-01-toDark.png?raw=true)

In FlexColorScheme v5 that has container colors for each main color
in the `ColorScheme`, a new way to produce the computed dark mode colors was added.
If you in dark mode, swap main and container colors, the colors will usually work
well as they are in dark mode, at least if
you followed the design principle for main color and its container color in light
theme mode.

You can then pass 'true' to the toDark method, indicating you have a "true" M3
light theme mode ColorScheme design. The `toDark` computation will swap the
colors from the light mode colors, and use it as a starting point for the
dark theme mode. This also produces a more design correct dark mode,
with respect to the shade tones used on main color and its container color.
You may not even need to add any white blend level to de-saturate the colors.
Below we use 5% to demonstrate that you can.

```dart
darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
  colors: FlexColor.schemes[FlexScheme.brandBlue]!
      .light.defaultError.toDark(5, true),
```

[<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-deep-02-toDark.png?raw=true" alt="V5 toDark-2"/>](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-deep-02-toDark.png?raw=true)

If your light theme mode colors follow the M3 design intent, then always use
the `toDark(level, true)` API. If you on the other have colors that are designed
with older M2 design intent, then using `toDark(level)` as before, which
defaults to `toDark(level, false)` is usually a better choice.

## Convenient AppBar Theming

Let's study what `FlexColorScheme` can do with the `AppBarTheme` and how you
can match it to your surface blending if you like.

You can easily toggle both dark and light mode AppBars to use differently
themed backgrounds. By default, Material design uses AppBars with
`ColorScheme.primary` color for light theme mode, and the dark background
color in dark theme mode. Without using a separately defined sub `AppBarTheme`,
**FlexColorScheme** AppBars can use different themed backgrounds based on
an enum value.

The themed `AppBar` background can use scheme primary color, default Material
plain white/dark background color, primary branded surface, primary branded
background color, or a custom AppBar color.

The `FlexColorScheme` scheme's `appBarColor` is a separate scheme color that
does not exist in Flutter's standard `ColorScheme`, so it does not have to be
any of the colors available in a `ColorScheme`.

The predefined schemes use the color defined in a `ColorScheme`
scheme's `tertiary` color, as their value for the custom `appBarColor`.
When you make your own schemes you can do the same or use a totally
none `ColorScheme` related color as the AppBar's custom color option. This
color then becomes one of the FlexColorScheme's easy selectable AppBar theme
color option, via the `appBarStyle` property and the `FlexAppBarStyle` enum,
in this case via the `custom` choice.

Below you can see some different primary color blend level using
background colors used as the themed AppBar background color.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="7">_Using background colored AppBar theme, that includes the primary color blend at different levels in the background_</td>
  </tr>
 </table>


## The TabBar Style

The `tabBarStyle` property can be used to toggle the theme the `TabBar`
receives. By default, a theme that is designed to make it fit in an `AppBar`,
regardless of which style you have selected for it, is used. This is the
`FlexTabBarStyle.forAppBar` style. The typical usage of a `TabBar` is to have
it in an `AppBar`, and the default style works for this use case.

Alternatively you can choose a style that makes a `TabBarTheme` that fits well
on background colors. Use this option if you intend to use the `TabBar` in a
`Scaffold` body, in Dialogs, Drawers or other surface and
background colored Material. If you do so, you do not have re-theme it, or
style it separately for this purpose.

If you intend to use `TabBar` widgets in both AppBars and on surface and
backgrounds, you will have to choose the style that most often fits your
use case. Then theme it separately for the other use case. You would have to do
the same with Flutter standard themes and `TabBarTheme` as well when not
using FlexColorScheme, but the first theme your get without effort.

Which `tabBarStyle` style and resulting `TabBarTheme` actually works best,
depends on the background color. Here we see TabBars used on surfaces and in
an `AppBar`, when the AppBar is using primary color. As can be seen, the tab bar
theme that goes well in an app bar in such a case, does not fit on the surfaces
at all, and wise versa.

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/TabBar-on-primary.png?raw=true" alt="tab bar on primary"/>](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/TabBar-on-primary.png?raw=true)

If you plan to use only surface or background (also the branded ones) colored
AppBars, you can see that both TabBar styles, and their resulting themes, work
for both situations. The difference is minor, and it is a matter of opinion
which one is preferable. Both style options can be used if you restrict your
AppBar color to background and surface colors, or their primary branded variants.
In such a use case you can get away with using just one of the built-in
style options, even if you use TabBars in both AppBars and on other surfaces.

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/TabBar-on-surface.png?raw=true" alt="tab bar on surface"/>](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/TabBar-on-surface.png?raw=true)

## True Black

Dark-mode is cool and with `FlexColorScheme` you can go even darker. Go **true black** with the flick of a
switch. When using the true black option for dark-mode, surface, background and scaffold background are set to
fully black. This can save power on OLED screens as the pixels are turned off, but it can also cause scrolling artefact
issues when pixels turn fully on and off rapidly as you scroll. You can read about this and see an example of it in
the [Material design guide](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#ui-application)
as well. (Scroll back up one heading from the link to get to the mention of it.)

If you use surface blends with true black mode enabled, you will notice that the surface blends have a lower impact,
only at higher blend levels does it have a visible effect. This is by design to keep most surfaces totally or
very close to black when true black is combined with surface blends. If you really want complete black
for all surfaces and backgrounds, then avoid combining true black mode with blended surfaces. On the other hand it
still makes a much darker theme than normal dark theme, which can look nice. It may also eliminate the scrolling issue, since
all background colored pixels are not fully off in the true black modes when you use higher blend levels.

Here is an example of a branded dark theme with true black OFF (default) and true black ON,
when using high surface blend level with the **Red red wine** color scheme.

    <td>[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/fcs_phone_ex5cd.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme example 5c dark" width="280"/>](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/fcs_phone_ex5cd.png?raw=true)</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">_Comparing true black OFF (left) and ON (right), with the **Red red wine** scheme._</td>

Here is another difference example with the **Deep blue sea** scheme, when using mid level blends, and
a primary colored AppBar in dark-mode.

## Themed System Navigation Bar in Android

The HomePage's build method for this example starts by wrapping the entire page content in an `AnnotatedRegion`
with a `SystemUiOverlayStyle` value that we get from the static helper
`FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar(context, ...)`.

Using this we can get a system navigation bar, typically on older Android phones that still uses one, that
follows the active theme's background color and theme mode. The system navigation bar will get updated as
you select new themes, different background color branding style and strength, and
toggle dark and light theme mode. Many Flutter applications neglect or forget to include this feature in their
application.

```dart
    return AnnotatedRegion<SystemUiOverlayStyle>(
      value: FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar(
        context,
        systemNavBarStyle: widget.controller.sysNavBarStyle,
        useDivider: widget.controller.useSysNavDivider,
        opacity: widget.controller.sysNavBarOpacity,
      ),
     ),
     child: ....
   );
```

Above the `systemNavBarStyle`, `useDivider` and `opacity` are tied the theme controller in example 5.
Together with the option to remove the status bar scrim, you can have easy complete control of both the
AppBar's status bar, and the system navigation bar look, like shown below:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/FlexSchemeAppBar.gif?raw=true" alt="AppBar StatusBar" width="280"/>](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/FlexSchemeAppBar.gif?raw=true)</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/FlexSchemeNavBar.gif?raw=true" alt="SysNavBar Style" width="280"/>](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/FlexSchemeNavBar.gif?raw=true)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">_Changing Android system status bar and navigation bar._</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The top status bar scrim toggle, system navigation bar divider and style only have an impact
on Android builds, they do not have any functionality on the live Web example.

**NOTE:**

* The static helper `FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar(context, ...)` is designed to provide a convenience
wrapper for a `SystemUiOverlayStyle` that works for screens that use and adhere to current theme mode colors.
If your application use screens that do not follow the current theme, then just use `SystemUiOverlayStyle`
directly in the annotated region for such screens to define their desired style. You can also make your own
convenience wrapper function or even just a const value for it if you need to use a fixed style and design frequently.


* There is a known issue in Flutter [#100027](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/100027)
  "Using systemNavigationBarDividerColor changes statusBarIconBrightness and
  systemNavigationBarIconBrightness on Android 11". It affects this feature. Two temporary
  changes were made to `FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar` implementation:
  * The divider feature is disabled until the issue has been resolved.
  * There is a temporary workaround implemented, it manages to keep system
     icons from getting the wrong brightness on Android 11 by calling systemChrome twice.
  The temporary changes will be reverted when the fix for the Flutter issue
  has reached the stable channel.


You can also use the `FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar` to hide the top status icons if you are not
using an app bar at all. This can be useful on a splash or onboarding page. Example 5 contains three different
examples, each with their own limitations, read more in the example 5 source code comments on how it
can be used, here what they look like. The last Example SplashPage 2, would be the ideal version, and it
works well on some versions of Android, but it seems to fail on newer ones, so you may prefer 1b instead.

[<img src="https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/FlexColorScheme-Splash-half-Size.png?raw=true" alt="ColorScheme Splash pages"/>](https://rydmike.com/assets_fcsv4/FlexColorScheme-Splash-half-Size.png?raw=true)

### Android Transparent System Navigation Bar

FlexColorScheme V4 added full support for transparent system navigation bar for Android
SDK >= 29 (Android 10). The support is added via the
[opacity](https://pub.dev/documentation/flex_color_scheme/latest/flex_color_scheme/FlexColorScheme/themedSystemNavigationBar.html)
property in `FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar`.
Use and support for the opacity value on the system navigation bar is supported
starting from Flutter 2.5. This [PR 28616](https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/28616) amended it a bit
and limits its functionality to SDK >= 29.

Examples 1 to 4 do not use the transparent or themed system navigation bar feature,
but **example 5**, the **Copy Playground** and the default example
**Hot Reload Playground** do. If you build them on an Android device you
can see it working if you use appropriate Android API levels that are supported.

When you build example 5 the **Themes Playground**" on an Android device you can
try and see the partially and even
fully transparent Android system navigation bar in action. You can adjust the settings on its
interactive "Android System Navigation Bar" panel. These settings are not a part of
theme that can be copied, since the required setup is not in ThemeData.

The themed and transparent system navigation bar work even if you used the
older 3 button system navigation, the two button option, or even with the thin
gestures navigation bar. It is just not as visible or obvious when using the
thin gestures based one.
