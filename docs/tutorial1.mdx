## Tutorials

In this tutorials we go through all the bundled examples and explain the
used `FlexColorScheme` features in each example.

The key part for each example is always in the used `MaterialApp`, where all the
FlexColorScheme setup for the themes are made. The rest of the content in the
examples is mainly there to make a visual presentation of the resulting theme from
the used color scheme, and to allow you to control the theme settings.

## Example 1 - Basic Theme Usage

The first and simplest example shows how you can use a predefined color scheme
in `FlexColorScheme` to define light and dark themes using the selected scheme.
How to turn it into a theme used by your application, and then switch between
its light and dark mode themes. A theme showcase widget shows the theme's effect
on several common Material UI widgets.

 ```dart
void main() => runApp(const DemoApp());

class DemoApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const DemoApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _DemoAppState createState() => _DemoAppState();
}

class _DemoAppState extends State<DemoApp> {
  // Used to select if we use the dark or light theme, start with system mode.
  ThemeMode themeMode = ThemeMode.system;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Select the predefined FlexScheme color scheme to use. Modify the
    // used FlexScheme enum value below to try other pre-made color schemes.
    const FlexScheme usedScheme = FlexScheme.mandyRed;

    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      scrollBehavior: AppScrollBehavior(),
      title: 'Basic Theme Usage',
      // Use a predefined FlexThemeData.light() theme for the light theme.
      theme: FlexThemeData.light(
        scheme: usedScheme,
        // Use very subtly themed app bar elevation in light mode.
        appBarElevation: 0.5,
      ),
      // Same definition for the dark theme, but using FlexThemeData.dark().
      darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
        scheme: usedScheme,
        // Use stronger themed app bar elevation in dark mode.
        appBarElevation: 2,
      ),
      // Use the above dark or light theme based on active themeMode.
      themeMode: themeMode,
      home: HomePage(
        // We pass it the current theme mode.
        themeMode: themeMode,
        // On the home page we can toggle theme mode between light and dark.
        onThemeModeChanged: (ThemeMode mode) {
          setState(() {
            themeMode = mode;
          });
        },
        // Pass in the FlexSchemeData we used for the active theme.
        flexSchemeData: FlexColor.schemes[usedScheme]!,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

To the `HomePage` we pass in the current value of the `themeMode` and use a
callback to get back its changed value, we use it to update
`themeMode` in a standard `setState` to make the app rebuild using
the new value.

We also pass in the `FlexSchemeData` we defined for our custom theme to the
`HomePage`. Not really needed, but we use it on the home page to show the
active theme's name, description and colors in a theme mode switch.

When you build and run **example 1** you get an application that looks
like this in light and dark mode:

Scroll down in the app to see the theme showcase further below. It presents the
theme with common Material UI widgets. You can try this example as a Flutter
[web app here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorschemeV4Tut1).
