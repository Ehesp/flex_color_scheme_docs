# Tutorial

In this tutorial we go through all the bundled examples and explain main used `FlexColorScheme` features in each example. It starts simple, with increasing complexity and ends with the complete [**Themes Playground V6**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v6) / [**Themes Playground V7**](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-v7) app included as [tutorial example 5](/tutorial5).

The key part, for each example, is always in the used `MaterialApp`, where the `FlexColorScheme` setup for the light and dark themes are made. The rest of the content in the examples is mainly there to make a visual presentation of the resulting theme from the used theme settings, and to allow you to control all settings interactively.

## 1. Basic Theme

The first and simplest example shows how you can use a predefined color scheme in `FlexColorScheme` as your applications light and dark themes. It demonstrates how to turn it into `ThemeData` that is used by your application and then switch between its light and dark theme modes.

A theme showcase widget shows the theme's effect on several common Material UI component widgets.

Only code highlights might be shown below. The complete code of this example can be found [here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/tree/master/example/lib/example1_basic_theme_usage).

 ```dart
void main() => runApp(const DemoApp());

class DemoApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const DemoApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _DemoAppState createState() => _DemoAppState();
}

class _DemoAppState extends State<DemoApp> {
  // Used to select if we use the dark or light theme, start with system mode.
  ThemeMode themeMode = ThemeMode.system;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Select the predefined FlexScheme color scheme to use. Modify the
    // used FlexScheme enum value below to try other pre-made color schemes.
    const FlexScheme usedScheme = FlexScheme.mandyRed;

    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: 'Basic Theme Usage',
      // Use a predefined FlexThemeData.light() theme for the light theme.
      theme: FlexThemeData.light(
        scheme: usedScheme,
        // Use very subtly themed app bar elevation in light mode.
        appBarElevation: 0.5,
      ),
      // Same definition for the dark theme, but using FlexThemeData.dark().
      darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
        scheme: usedScheme,
        // Use a bit more themed elevated app bar in dark mode.
        appBarElevation: 2,
      ),
      // Use the above dark or light theme based on active themeMode.
      themeMode: themeMode,
      home: HomePage(
        // We pass it the current theme mode.
        themeMode: themeMode,
        // On the home page we can toggle theme mode between light and dark.
        onThemeModeChanged: (ThemeMode mode) {
          setState(() {
            themeMode = mode;
          });
        },
        flexSchemeData: FlexColor.schemes[usedScheme]!,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

To the `HomePage` we pass in the current value of the `themeMode` and use a simple callback to get back its changed value. We then use it to update `themeMode` in a standard `setState` to make the app rebuild using the new value. We also pass in the `FlexSchemeData` for the `usedScheme` we selected as our custom theme to the `HomePage`. Not really needed, but we use it on the home page to show the active theme's name, description and colors in a theme mode switch.

The key part to notice above is that `FlexThemeData.light` and `FlexThemeData.dark` return a standard Flutter `ThemeData` object to your application's `MaterialApp` `theme` and `darkTheme` properties. The `ThemeData` content returned is however highly refined, can be extensively and quickly customized using a simple API, that creates very elaborate `ThemeData` objects.

This also puts limits on what `FlexColorScheme` can do, it can only modify your application's theme in ways that is supported by Flutter's `ThemeData`. This can also be reassuring, since you can be sure that all it does is help you define a fancy `ThemeData` object for your application, and that everything it does, you can do directly with `ThemeData` too, it might just be very verbose and time-consuming to do so.

Since `FlexColorScheme` at the end of the day returns a `ThemeData` object, you can also further modify and customize anything it has done, by using `ThemeData`'s own `copyWith` property.

## Result

When you build and run **example 1**, you get an application that looks like this in light theme mode:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>[<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-tut1-l-01.png?raw=true" alt="Basic1" width="280"/>](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-tut1-l-01.png?raw=true)</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td colspan="5">_Using a built-in FlexColorScheme color scheme as application light theme_</td>
  </tr>
 </table>

 And in dark theme mode:

 <table>
  <tr>
    <td>[<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-tut1-d-01.png?raw=true" alt="Basic1" width="280"/>](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-tut1-d-01.png?raw=true)</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td colspan="5">_Using a built-in FlexColorScheme color scheme as application dark theme_</td>
  </tr>
 </table>

Scroll down in the app to see the theme showcase further below. It presents the theme with common Material UI widgets. You can try this example as a Flutter web app [using V6 here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/basictheme-v6) and [V7 here](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/basictheme-v7).
