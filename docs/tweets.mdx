# Tweet Summaries

Over the years, a number of Twitter threads have been created to present new release of FlexColorScheme and Themes Playground. You can find them below. They are useful as a summary of new features and changes in releases. The tweet threads also serve as a nice historic log that shows how FlexColorScheme has evolved over time. It starts with the oldest version.

Some threads are not release related, but useful general theming guides.
