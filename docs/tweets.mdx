# History in Tweets

Over the years, a number of Tweet threads have been created to present new release of **FlexColorScheme** and **Themes Playground**. You can find them below. They are useful as a summary of new features and changes in releases. The tweet threads also serve as a nice historic log that shows how FlexColorScheme has evolved over time. 

Some threads are not release related, but useful general theming guides. You can also use the last few threads as a feature update about what is new in FlexColorScheme world. Together from start to finnish, they also work as TLDR for learning how to use FlexColorScheme and what you can do with it. 

## Version 1
_December 21, 2020_

First humble release of FlexColorScheme 1.0.0. There is not even a tweet about it. It launched with 20 different built-in color schemes. There is a tweet for the **version 1.1** released shortly after, on _December 29, 2020_. The tweet also shows the very modest version of example 5, that much later evolved into the **Themes Playground**.

### Version 1.2
_January 4, 2021_

The journey to add more color schemes started in version 1.2, by adding 4 new ones. **Amber blue**, **Vesuvius burned**, **Deep purple** and **Ebony clay**, taking the number of built-in schemes from 20 to 24.

**Version 1.3** was released a few days later on _January 7, 2021_. It added more tests, made some internal improvements and marked `FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.themeSurface` as deprecated in favor of the correctly named `FlexSchemeSurfaceColors.surfaceStyle`. It was a silent fix without any tweet announcements.

### Version 1.4
_January 18, 2021_

Version 1.4 added a simper API for using built-in schemes, the still used `schemes` property. It contained first experimental support for Android transparent system navigation bar. Added the reference table for built-in schemes. It also automated the test pipe using Codecov and hit 99% code test coverage.

### Version 1.4.1
_January 4, 2021_

This version should have been called 1.5.0, since it added new features in the form of 4 new themes. This time **Barossa**, **Shark and orange**, **Big stone tulip** and **Damask and lunar**. The number of color themes now grew from 24 to 28.

## Version 2
_March 15, 2021_

Version 2.0 was the step of going to sound-null safety and Dart 2.0. Test coverage also reached 99.78%. Feature wise it did not bring anyhing new, but it was a needed and significant chore update.

## Version 3 
_June 26, 2021_

Version 3 was the first release with a real Tweet thread summary. It was also the first major release after the null-safety upgrade. The only breaking change was removing `accentColor`, that was getting deprecated in Flutter SDK.

Version 3 also added four new built-in color themes, **Bahama and trinidad**, **Mallard and valencia**, **Espresso and crema** and **Outer space stage**, increasing the total number of color themes from 28 to 32. A minor new feature allowing swapping primary and secondary colors in a scheme with a quick setting, was also added.

## Version 4
_November 14, 2021_

In version 4, the feature to opt-in on using opinionated component theming was first introduced. It offered the first take on what is still available as a very opinionated optional style for Material-2. To make it look, and to a degree emulate coming Material-3 design. The release was a major step forward in features. It only had a few minor style breaking changes. APIs were actually unbroken, but the minor breakage in a few past theme styles and major new feature warranted and new major release bump.

### Version 4.1
_November 20, 2021_

Version 4.1 release was when **Example 5** in the tutorial, started to take off and evolve into the **Themes Playground**. It got its feature that enables it to generate API config code, that can be copied and used to re-use the configured theme in an app.

### Version 4.2
_January 24, 2022_

In version 4.2, support for Flutter 2.8 was added. The release required using minimum Flutter 2.8.0 and Dart 2.15. FlexColorScheme also received its [Flutter Favorite](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/favorites) status in conjunction with [Flutter 2.8 release on December 9, 2021](https://medium.com/flutter/whats-new-in-flutter-2-8-d085b763d181). 

This release is also one where it first became necessary to start limiting new FlexColorScheme releases Flutter backwards compatibility, to latest releases. This is simply due to constant additions and changes in theming properties offered and changed in the Flutter SDK. This mode is still going on today with new Material3 features being added, and ThemeData color properties constantly being deprecated. 

Version 4.2 also added many new features, one of them being changing `ColorScheme` color mappings on component theme level. It also added support for the first real Material-3 style component, the `NavigationBar`.

## Version 5
_April 21, 2022_

This major release got four new built-in color schemes, for a total of 40 matched light and dark pairs. The release was also one of the biggest new feature additions made in a single major release. It was style wise also a big breaking change, since all the built-in produced ColorSchemes the themes used were revised to follow the new Flutter 2.10.0 Material-3 based ColorScheme. Seed generated ColorScheme using more than one seed color and custom chroma config limits were also introduced.

This version also included the launch of the documentation web-site that you are reading now.

The actual meat and info about version 5 was tweeted already a week earlier, in its 5.0.0-dev1 release. The dev or beta release thread is valid also for the final 5.0.0 released features. It presents all the new features with much detail in 24 tweeted slides.

Version 5 is also where the **Themes Playground** started getting its current form and many of the features it has today.
