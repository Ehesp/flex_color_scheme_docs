# flex_color_scheme_docs

This is the documentation repository for the Flutter **FlexColorScheme** package found on
pub.dev [here](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme) and its public code repository is on
GitHub [here](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme).

The documentation site is made with [docs.page](https://docs.page/) by Invertase.

The documentation for FlexColorScheme is kept in a separate repository for increased flexibility
of documentation maintenance, and in order to not pollute the code repository with a large
amount of media files.
